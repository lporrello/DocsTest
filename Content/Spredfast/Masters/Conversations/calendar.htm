        <p>The Calendar provides information about scheduled and published messages. Use the Calendar to view attachments, including video, and track, edit, or delete messages.</p>
        <p>By default, the Calendar displays items published and scheduled by you and others in your current Initiative (unless your Workspace has been defined so that you see only your own items). Using filters, you can see items from other Initiatives on your Calendar. When you have multiple Initiatives on your calendar, the Label filter updates to include the labels from all visible Initiatives.</p>
