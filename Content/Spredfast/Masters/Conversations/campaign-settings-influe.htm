        <h1>Influencers<MadCap:keyword term="Influencer(s): importing lists of; Import: influencers lists" /></h1>
        <p>“Influencers” are individuals whose social media activities are particularly important for you to monitor; their actions impact your business objectives for the Initiative. Each company develops its own criteria for determining who is an “influencer,” and the criteria can be different for each Initiative. </p>
        <p>If you have a list of influencers, you can upload it into the system using a simple CSV file, or you can upload a CSV generated by Traacker. If you choose to create your own CSV file, it must contain <b>Service</b> and <b>User Identifier</b> column headings, in which Service is the name of the social media channel and User Identifier is the unique value for the individual. A sample CSV file can be downloaded from the application, edited, and re-imported.</p>
        <p>The following services and identifiers are supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Twitter: user ID, user name, or profile URL</li>
            <li>Facebook: user ID or profile URL</li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can export the current influencer list from the system. The file includes the service and identifier data, as well as any additional information displayed in the social profile. This file can also be re-imported.<MadCap:keyword term="Export: influencers list" /></p>
