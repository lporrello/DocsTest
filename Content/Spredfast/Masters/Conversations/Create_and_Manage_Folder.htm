        <h1>Create and Manage Folders</h1>
        <p>All Assets in the Content Center are organized into folders. The Folder Owner initially decides who can see and act upon the assets within it. When it’s first created (by default), the folder and its contents can be seen and acted upon by the user who added it. A folder can be shared with all the users in your Company, all the users in a particular Initiative, or with individual (named) users. When sharing a folder, the Folder Owner decides the type of access others have. </p>
        <p>Folder sharing rules can be assigned when the folder is first created, or at a later time, using the <b>Share</b> icon for the <b>[Folder name]</b> &gt; <b>Share Folder</b> option in the action bar. Folder sharing rules can be subsequently changed by other users with the correct permissions.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Folder Sharing and User Permissions</b>
            <br />Folder sharing is <b>used to limit, not extend</b>, a user’s abilities in the Content Center. For example...<br />If a user’s role allows him to publish content, but he has been given only Can View access to a folder, he cannot publish assets from that folder.<br />If a user’s role does not allow him to publish content, but he is given Can Publish access to a folder, he will not be allowed to publish assets from the folder.</p>
        <p class="note">Sharing for Initiatives, Companies, and Named Users<br />If a user has access to a folder as a member of an Initiative or company, and as a named individual, whichever access gives her <b>the most capabilities</b> is used. For example, if you have Can View access as a member of an Initiative, but have Can Publish access as an individual, you are allowed to publish assets from the folder. </p>
        <p><b>Company members can be permitted to do the following:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See and download assets (View)</li>
            <li>Publish assets (Publish). (Remember that a user must also have a role that allows publishing, plus access to the account in order to publish.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Initiative Members Can be permitted to do the following:</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ul>
            <li>See and download assets (View)</li>
            <li>Publish assets (Publish). (Remember that a user must also have a role that allows publishing, plus access to the account in order to publish.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Individual (named) users can be permitted to do the following:</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add new assets to the folder (Create) </li>
            <li>Edit asset content or properties (Edit)</li>
            <li>Publish assets (Publish) (Remember that a user must also have publishing and content center roles that allows publishing, plus access to the account in order to publish.)</li>
            <li>See and download assets (View)</li>
            <li>These privileges are hierarchical--if a user has Create, for example, he also has all the privileges listed beneath (Edit, Publish, and View). </li>
