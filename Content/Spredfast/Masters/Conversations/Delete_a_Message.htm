        <h1>Delete a Message<MadCap:keyword term="Delete: message; Messages: deleting" /></h1>
        <p><b>Before an individual message (of any type) is published</b>, it can be removed from the agenda by a user with the proper permissions. If a message (microblog) is one of a set of reposts, the single instance of the message is deleted. If a message is one of a series, the user is asked whether the single message or all messages in the series should be deleted. </p>
        <p><b>After a message is published</b>, it can no longer be removed from the Agenda, but can be removed from the Message Detail screen. When a message is deleted using the Message Detail screen, all associated metrics are removed from the Account Sets/accounts used to publish the message. The message is NOT deleted from the channel on which it was published; for example, removing a Facebook post using the Message Detail screen only removes the message from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />; it does NOT remove the message from Facebook.</p>
