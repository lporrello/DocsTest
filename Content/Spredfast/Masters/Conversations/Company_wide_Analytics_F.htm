        <h1>Company-wide Analytics Filters</h1>
        <p>In Company-wide analytics, the default view of the dashboards contains data for all the Initiatives you have access to. A series of filters lets you narrow that large data set down so that you see only what you need. Filters in the Company Analytics dashboards are “sticky”—that is, the most recently used filter is remembered for each user. </p>
        <p>When selecting individual items within a filter, you are limited to 500 items, such as 500 labels or 500 users. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Apply the date range filter first</b>
            <br />Note that when you change a date range value, the page immediately refreshes using the new range. Set the correct date range before applying other filter criteria.</p>
        <p>Initially, the <b>Apply</b> button is disabled on a page. When you begin to select criteria within a filter type (such as specific channels), the filter text appears in italics, indicating that criteria has been selected, but not applied. Select criteria for as many fields as you want, then click <b>Apply</b>. The following filters are available in Company Analytics: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Initiative</b>—Select all Initiatives, or only specific ones. The list contains all Initiatives you have access to. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Company-wide Metrics</b>
            <br />If you want to run reports on social media efforts company-wide, make sure you have access to all company Initiatives. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Account Set</b>—Contains all Account Sets that are part of the Initiatives selected in the Initiative filter. Select all or only specific ones. </li>
            <li><b>Channel</b>—Contains all channels that have been authenticated in the Initiatives selected in the Initiative filter. </li>
            <li><b>Account</b>—Contains all accounts that are part of Initiatives selected in the Initiative filter. Select all or only specific ones. (Pinterest Boards are included as accounts.)</li>
            <li><b>Date Range</b>—Select the number of days to include. You can select a range of specific dates using the calendars. You can view data going back up to 13 months. <b>Apply this filter first.</b></li>
            <li><b>Label (Label 1)</b>—Choose Label(s) that have been applied to outbound (published) messages. (For metrics related to Inbound labels (such as Customer Care metrics and reports on labels applied from the Inbox), see <MadCap:xref href="dashboard.htm">Initiative Analytics</MadCap:xref>).<br />For example: If you select “Customer Outreach” and “Marketing,” you will get messages that have either label applied to them.</li>
            <li><b>Label 2</b>—Use the Label 2 filter to make “&amp;” (AND-type) queries with the Label 1 filter.<br />For example: If you set Label 1 to “Customer Outreach” and “Marketing”, and Label 2 to “Whitepaper,” you would get messages that have:<ul><li>Both Customer Outreach and Whitepaper</li><li>Both Marketing and Whitepaper</li><li>Customer Outreach and Marketing, and Whitepaper</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>User name</b>—Select all or specific users. The list contains users who have at least one publishing record in the selected Initiative(s).</li>
            <li><b>Targeting Profile</b>—Choose Facebook targeting profiles that have been created and saved within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />. See <MadCap:xref href="campaign-settings-target_1.htm">Targeting Profiles</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Unpublished Page Post: in Analytics" /><b>Unpublished Page Posts (Facebook only. Also known as “Dark Posts.”)</b>—Select Previously Unpublished Posts (For items that were originally created as dark posts, then subsequently published; these items are no longer counted as dark posts once they are published), Published Page Posts, or Unpublished Page Posts (Dark Posts).<br />See <MadCap:xref href="Targeting.htm">Targeting</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Responses: in Company-wide metrics filters" /><b>Responses</b>—Within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, “responses” are items that are published in response to content that appears in Inbox streams. It can sometimes be helpful to exclude this type of publishing activity from performance analysis. To exclude responses, open the filter and deselect (uncheck) <b>response</b>. Then click <b>Apply</b>. <br />The following are counted as Responses in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />: <ul><li>Messages published using the “Amplify” feature in the Inbox</li><li>Twitter Replies and Direct Messages made from the Inbox</li><li>Facebook Private Messages (published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> or auto-imported).</li><li>Twitter Retweets (both types, Editable and ‘native’) made from the Inbox</li><li>Comments made from the Inbox on Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Weibo, Instagram, or Google+ Posts. Facebook and Weibo Replies are counted as Comments.</li><li>For Tweets published outside of <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, then auto-imported, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> considers the Tweet a “response” if the Tweet begins with “RT” or if Twitter identifies the Tweet as a response within the metadata it provides (the in_reply_to_status_id value is set).</li><li>Weibo reposts made from the Inbox</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Company Analytics Filters can be saved and reused. Saved filters are available per Dashboard. (For example, a filter you create in the All Channels dashboard is available on all the tabs in the All Channels dashboard, but is not available on the Twitter dashboard.) Filters you create are not visible to anyone but yourself.</p>
