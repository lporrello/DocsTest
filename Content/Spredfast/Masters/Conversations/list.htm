        <p>Inside <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you use the <b>Inbox</b> to follow all the conversations and content that make up your social media Initiatives. In order for any type of material to appear in the <b>Inbox</b>, you must instruct the system to capture it. To do this, you create ongoing searches, or queries, that define the items you want to look for (terms such as the name of your organization or product, for example, or all of the messages that are posted by a particular account), and where you want to look for them (on Facebook or Twitter, for example). The system performs these searches, and presents the results as a flow of data, called a stream.<MadCap:keyword term="Inbox: about" /></p>
        <p>A “stream,” then, is a view of returned search results, presented in a column format. Once a stream has been created, it’s available to any user in the Initiative. Multiple streams can be combined into a Collection, so that the contents of all the selected streams appear in a single column.<MadCap:keyword term="Streams: defined" /></p>
        <p>You also use the <b>Inbox</b> to process the social media items that appear in streams. You may want to respond to a post, highlight it for someone else, or classify/categorize it in some way. Each posted item contains actions that can be taken on it. </p>
        <p>The Inbox is divided into two areas: Tabs and the Stream Library.</p>
