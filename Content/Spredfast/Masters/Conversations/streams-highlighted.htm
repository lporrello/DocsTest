Items that are highlighted for you (by yourself or others) are shown with a pale yellow background. Items that are highlighted for others are shown with a white background.</p>
        <p> If you are a member of a team, and an item has been highlighted for the team, it appears in your Highlighted stream with a pale yellow background. Actions taken on highlighted items are summarized in the <b>Details</b> panel and shown in the hover text over the action type. (For example, recent Highlight activity is summarized when you hover over the Highlights entry in the <b>Details</b> panel.) </p>
        <p>You can only highlight items for users whose Workspaces include access to the Inbox. </p>
        <p>Use the <b>Show Items</b> menu in the <b>Stream Management</b> menu (chevron icon) at the top of the Highlighted stream to change the type of items displayed in the stream. </p>
        <p>You can select from the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All highlighted items</li>
            <li>All highlighted for me</li>
            <li>All highlighted by me</li>
            <li>All unaccepted items (highlighted for me individually, plus those highlighted for any highlight teams I am on) </li>
            <li>All my unaccepted items (highlighted individually for me)</li>
            <li>All unaccepted items for my Highlight team(s)</li>
            <li>My accepted items</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Show Items</b> works together with the regular stream filter (<b>Stream Management</b> (chevron icon) &gt; <b>Add filter</b>); for example, you can apply a date range filter, then apply an <b>All Unaccepted Items</b> quick filter to the results. </p>
        <p>From the Highlighted steam, you can accept and release items; the accepted status appears in the <b>Details</b> panel for the stream item. You can only accept items that have been highlighted for you (as an individual or as a member of a highlight team), and that have not been accepted by another user. You cannot accept items that appear in your Highlighted stream because you’ve highlighted them for other users.</p>
        <p>For more information on using the Highlighted stream to manage conversations, see <MadCap:xref href="Highlight.htm">Highlight</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>You can move items from the Highlighted stream into your personal archive (<b>Archive</b>), and return them to the Highlighted stream using <b>Restore from Archive</b>. </p>
