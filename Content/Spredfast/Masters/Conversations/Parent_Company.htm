        <h1>Parent Company</h1>
        <p>A “Parent Company” is a structural concept within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> used to group multiple organizations (companies) under a single entity (parent company). Each company can have one parent. Each parent can have multiple children. Once a parent company has been configured in the system, you can associate its child companies with it. You cannot change a current company into a parent company, and a parent company cannot have its own Initiatives or users; it is a “container” for companies only.<MadCap:keyword term="Company: parent; Parent Company" /> </p>
        <h2>Create a Parent Company</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Company Configuration</b>
            <br />Associating a new company with a parent can also be done when the (child) company is first added to <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />.</p>
