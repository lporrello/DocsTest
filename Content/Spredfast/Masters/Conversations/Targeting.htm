        <h2>Facebook Page Post Targeting<MadCap:keyword term="Facebook: targeting; Gated Target; Enhanced Target; Page Post Targeting (Facebook); Targeting: Facebook" /></h2>
        <p><b>For Facebook Pages only</b>—Page Post Targeting allows you to direct messages to specific types of viewers. There are two types of Facebook targeting: <b>Gated</b> and <b>Enhanced</b>. The type of target you choose determines where the message is published, and who can see it. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gated targets</b>—allow you to post messages to fans based on location and language. Only the targeted fan audience will see the post, in the page’s Timeline and in the fan’s news feed.</li>
            <li> <b>Enhanced targets</b>—allow you to choose additional criteria, including age, gender, education, and others. Messages posted using Enhanced targeting appear in news feed of the targeted fans, as well as to all other viewers of the page Timeline—whether or not the viewers are fans of the page, and whether or not they meet the targeting criteria. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gated and Enhanced target types are compared in the following table. </p>

        <h2>Gated Targets</h2>
        <p>Facebook messages that use a Gated target appear only to fans (<b>people who have liked the page</b>) in specified countries, states/provinces, cities, or who use a particular language. Places/languages available for targeting are those supported by Facebook. Only one target can be chosen for each message, even if the message is going to multiple pages. (The targeting is applied to all Pages you select in Accounts). </p>
        <p><b>For locations</b>—You must start with a country. Two “levels” are permitted. If you select multiple countries, then “the world” is considered as the top level, and you can only select countries.

        <ul>
            <li>states and provinces within the country</li>
            <li>cities in states and provinces, or </li>
            <li>everybody in the country.</li>

        <h2>Create Facebook Unpublished Page Posts<MadCap:keyword term="Unpublished Page Post: about; Facebook: Unpublished Page Post, creating; Dark posts (Facebook)" /></h2>
        <p>Unpublished Page Posts (sometimes called “dark posts”) are special Facebook messages that appear only as promoted messages in the Newsfeed. They never appear in the Page’s Timeline, and are often used by Brands to test the effectiveness of their messages, or to compare performance of different message texts without creating multiple posts on the same topic, or publishing too many similar posts at or around the same time. These posts can be created in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> for any authenticated Facebook Page. Once created, they can be published using Facebook Power Editor. To obtain metrics information for Unpublished Page Posts, see <MadCap:xref href="Company_wide_Analytics_F.htm">Company-wide Analytics Filters</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>While creating a Facebook message, in the <b>Accounts</b> pane, select a Facebook Page account.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Targeting</b>, and add gated or enhanced targeting if appropriate.</li>

        <h2>Target a Twitter Message<MadCap:keyword term="Twitter: targeting; Targeting: Twitter" /></h2>
        <p>You can target an organic tweet to users in one or more countries. Here are Some things to know about Twitter targeting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tweets will appear in Followers’ Timelines if Twitter determines the Followers are in the targeted country. The tweets will also appear in search streams created by non-Followers in the targeted country. </li>
            <li>The tweets will not appear in the publishing account’s native Twitter timeline, unless the account is located in the targeted country. The tweets will appear in the Inbox, however.</li>
            <li>Targeting is automatically applied to reposts, but is not applied to <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> automated retweets.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>While creating a Twitter message, in the <b>Accounts</b> panel, select a Twitter account.</li>

        <h2>Target a Google+ Circle<MadCap:keyword term="Targeting: Google+; Google+: targeting" /></h2>
        <p><b>For Google+ Company Page updates only.</b> By default, Google+ posts are visible to any Google+ user who visits the Company page. With targeting, you can make posts visible only to members of specific circles. A Google+ targeted message can be sent to multiple circles for each account. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>While creating a Google+ message, in the <b>Accounts</b> menu, select a Google+ Company Page Account.</li>

        <h2>Target a LinkedIn Company<MadCap:keyword term="LinkedIn: targeting; Targeting: LinkedIn" /></h2>
        <p><b>For LinkedIn Company Updates only</b>. By default, LinkedIn Company updates appear to Linkedin users who are following the company. Messages can be targeted to followers whose current LinkedIn profiles include one or more of the following criteria: company size, industry, job function, seniority, geography. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Minimum Number of Followers Required</b>
            <br />A LinkedIn Company targeted post must have an estimated reach of at least 100 followers. When a LinkedIn Company is authenticated in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, the system verifies that the company has at least 100 followers. If it does not, the targeting feature is disabled for the company. The feature is subsequently enabled when the follower count reaches 100. When building targeted posts for multiple companies, if one of the selected companies has fewer than 100 followers, targeting is not permitted for any of the companies. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>While creating a Linkedin message, in the <b>Accounts</b> panel, select a LinkedIn Company Account.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Targeting</b>. </li>
