        <h1>Retweet<MadCap:keyword term="Retweet: scheduled" /></h1>
        <p>Schedule an automated <b>Retweet</b> to post from 15 minutes to six hours after the original tweet. This feature is available only to users who have access to more than one account.</p>
        <p>The retweet consists of: “RT @ [credit] +text” and the text can be edited; the retweet content can be different than the content originally published. The option to “credit” a retweet only appears if the original was posted on multiple accounts.</p>
        <p>Automated retweets do not appear on the Agenda until after the first (original) tweet is published. Retweets can be edited once they appear on the agenda. Metrics for retweets are tracked individually (treated as independent messages). </p>
