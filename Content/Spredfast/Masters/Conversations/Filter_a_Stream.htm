        <h1>Filter a Stream<MadCap:keyword term="Streams: filter; Filters: stream" /></h1>
        <p>Filter stream content using the following criteria: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data (including date range)</li>
            <li>Labels (items with any label, no labels or specific labels; you can use advanced expressions to find specific labels and exclude others)</li>
            <li>Influencer (whether the author of the item has been identified as an Influencer)</li>
            <li>Visibility (view or hide dark posts)</li>
            <li>Notes (items with or without notes)</li>
            <li>Search terms</li>
            <li>Responses (whether <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> users have published or have pending, a response to the items)</li>
            <li>Retweets (to include/exclude retweets, or show only retweets). </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create a Stream Filter</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the chevron (Stream Management) icon in the stream header, and then choose <b>Filter</b>.</li>
            <li>Build the filter using the criteria described above. </li>
            <li>To make the filter available for reuse, click <b>Save Filter As...</b>, and name the filter. Then, click <b>Save &amp; Apply</b>.</li>
            <li>If you do not wish to save the filter, click <b>Apply</b> without adding a filter name.</li>
            <li>When a stream is filtered, a notification appears in the stream heading, <b>Filter On X</b>. To remove the filter, click the <b>X</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>“No filter applied” means that the particular criterion (Notes, for example) is not considered in the filter. You can name and reuse filters. </p>
        <p>If you have listening (from Sysomos or Synthesio) enabled for the stream or collection, an additional filter set appears. Across the top of the <b>Filters</b> dialog, you will have one tab for each vendor that is enabled for your company.</p>

        <p class="note"><b>Filtered Streams in Tabs</b>
            <br />If you have applied a filter to an active stream, the filter remains in effect if you drag the stream to a new location in the tab, or to a different tab. If you remove the stream (so that it is no longer part of an active tab and appears only in the All Streams section of the Stream Library), the filter is removed.</p>
