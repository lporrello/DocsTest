It contains the most important streams—the ones that everyone working in the Initiative needs to read. An orange dot is used to mark unread items. </p>
        <p>As of April 2014 (the 5.4 release) <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> is making some internal data processing changes that may influence the items that appear in your Primary Collection stream. Historically, items appeared in the Primary Collection as of the date a stream was added to the Inbox (no items from before that date were included). After the change, historical items (published before the date the stream was added to the Inbox, up to the last 100 days) will also appear. Users will see these changes take effect in the weeks following the release; the items will appear in the stream as “Unread.”</p>
