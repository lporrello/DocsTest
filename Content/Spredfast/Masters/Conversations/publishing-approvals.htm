        <h1>Workflow</h1>
        <p>Use the Workflow pane to change assignees, add supplemental approval teams, and add notes to a message. </p>
        <h2><a name="Assignme"></a>Assignment<MadCap:keyword term="Users: assignee; Assignee: changing for a message" /></h2>
        <p>To change the assignee for a post, click in the <b>Assigned to</b> menu and select a user.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have permission to assign messages, only your name appears in the list. If you have permission to assign messages, then the list includes all users who have permission to Create and Edit Own Messages, and have a workspace that includes both Publishing and the Calendar (set to Yes).</p>
        <h2><a name="Approval"></a>Approvals<MadCap:keyword term="Approval teams: supplemental" /></h2>
        <p>For messages that require approval before they are published, <b>Approvals</b> shows the required teams (based on the selected Account Set(s)), in the order they will be notified. You can require approval from supplemental (extra) teams; available ones appear in the list. (For a team to be available, at least one member of the team must have access to the Initiative.) If you make any changes to the set of approvals, the approval path is reset, and the message has to receive all required approvals again, even if the message content has not changed. </p>
        <p>For more information on the approval process, see <MadCap:xref href="About_Approvals.htm">About Approvals</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Making Changes to Supplemental Approval Teams</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For individual microblog messages, you can make changes to the list of supplemental teams at any time.</li>
            <li>For microblog messages that are part of a Series, you can make changes to the list of supplemental approval teams, but you must make the change on each individual message in the series; making a change on one does not make the change on the rest of the messages in the series. </li>
            <li>For individual messages of other types (video, photo, presentation, discussion topic), you can make changes to the list of supplemental teams <b>up until content for the message has been saved</b>. Once you save content, you can no longer make changes to the list of supplemental teams, even if you change the schedule for the message. </li>
            <li>Similarly, for other message types (video, photo, discussion topic), that are on a repeating schedule (the <b>Repeat</b>/<b>Repeat every</b> fields are set), you can make changes to the list of supplemental teams up <b>until the content for the original item is saved</b>. Once content for the first item is saved, changes cannot be made to the list of supplemental teams for any of the following “repeats” of the message. </li>
        </ul>
