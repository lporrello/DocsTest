        <p>Within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you can “archive” items from the Primary Collection and from the Highlighted stream. The archive function on the Primary Collection stream is Initiative-wide, meaning that if one user in the Initiative archives an item from her Primary Collection, the item appears in the other users’ Primary Collection archives, too. </p>
        <p>The archive function on the Highlighted stream is a personal user archive; items placed in the archive by one user do not automatically appear in another user’s Highlight archive. </p>
        <p>Archived items are a subset of “read” items; if an item is archived is automatically marked as read. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <b>Restore from Archive</b> to return items to the Primary Collection or Highlighted Stream. </li>
        </ul>
