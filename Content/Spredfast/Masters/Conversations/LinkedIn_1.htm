        <h2>Comment</h2>
        <p>Please note, company accounts cannot comment on Company updates.</p>
        <p>You can add a simple comment by clicking the <b>Comment</b> icon, typing in the content field, and clicking <b>Comment</b>. <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> will use the account that originally created the stream to publish it. Or, click the <b>More options</b> button to use an expanded set of publishing features (other accounts, scheduling, notes, labels, etc.) for your post.</p>
        <h2>Like a LinkedIn Post</h2>
        <p>From the stream item, click <b>Like</b> and choose accounts. Once an item has been liked via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, it can be unliked as well. The history of “Like” actions taken in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" /> is shown in the stream item entry (account, date, and time). Note that the <b>Likes</b> count is not the total number of times the item was liked on LinkedIn; it is the number of times the item was liked from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />.</p>
        <h2>Reply (As an Individual or a Company).</h2>
        <p>You can add a simple reply by clicking the <b>Reply</b> icon, typing in the content field, and clicking <b>Reply</b>. Or, click the <b>More options</b> button to use an expanded set of publishing features (other accounts, scheduling, notes, labels, etc.) for your post. By default, the Company is used to reply, but you can select individual user accounts instead. </p>
