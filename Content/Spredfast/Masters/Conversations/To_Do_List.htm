        <h1>To-Do List</h1>
        <p style="mc-hyphenate: never;">The To-do list, organized by day, spans from two weeks in the past, to one week in the future and contains...</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="mc-hyphenate: never;">A count of items highlighted for you (does not include items highlighted for Highlight teams of which you are a member).</li>
            <li style="mc-hyphenate: never;">Scheduled publishing events for which you are assignee, and some action is required—the message has a status of Needs Content, Error, Draft, Rejected, Needs approval. </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="mc-hyphenate: never;">Items older than two weeks drop off from the list. If items are deleted from the Agenda, they disappear from the list as well. Archiving a Highlighted item removes it from the list. </p>
