        <h1>Messages</h1>
        <h2>Twitter Messages (Count)</h2>
        <p>The sum of Tweets published by all Twitter accounts in the Initiatives, over the date range. The number is the total over the date range; click it to see the sum per account. The graph shows the trend in publishing activity over multiple weeks; click on a week’s data point to see messages published per account for that specific week. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Twitter Average Engagement</h2>
        <p>The number is the sum of all engagement (clicks, replies, favorites, native and editable retweets) received by all messages published during the date range by all Twitter accounts in the Initiatives, divided by the number of messages published. Click to see average engagement for messages published by each account. The graph shows the trend over multiple weeks; click a data point for details on each account during a specific week. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>Date range reflects time of message publication</b>
            <br />The date range defines when the message was published, not when the engagement was received. For example: you published a message a month ago. If you filter the data based on the week you published the message, the results return all engagement activity received for the message, over the entire month. This is because some messages, such as videos, can take a long time for their maximum engagement to be achieved.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>No Engagement Metrics for Native Retweets</b> <br />Though “native” Retweets posted through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> are counted as publishing activity in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, engagement metrics are not available for them. (From Twitter’s perspective, a native Retweet is an additional instance of the original tweet, not a separate tweet that can have independent, measurable engagement. Any engagement on the Retweet would be credited to the original Tweet.) <br />So if you post a “native” Retweet using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, and other people engage with the retweet, that engagement is not counted. Consequently, Average Engagement ratios may be skewed. If you must have engagement metrics on all retweets published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, limit users to Editable Retweets only. </p>
        <p class="note">
            <b>Favorites Count Limitation</b>
            <br />
            <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> collects Favorites data for an account’s 3200 most recent tweets. Once a tweet falls outside that limit (Tweet 3201), its Favorites count is no longer updated. Over long periods of time, or for very active Twitter accounts, users may see a discrepancy between Twitter and <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> Favorites counts.</p>

        <h2>Twitter Engagement by Type</h2>
        <p>The number is the sum of all engagement (clicks, replies, favorites, “native” and editable retweets) received by all messages published during the date range by all Twitter accounts in the Initiatives; click it to see the engagement sums per account. For each engagement type (Clicks, Replies, Favorites, Editable RT, Native RT), the top-level numbers represent the sum for all accounts; click on the number for each type to see engagement values of that type for each account. </p>
