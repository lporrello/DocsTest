        <h1>Resize an Asset (Image Studio)</h1>
        <p>Use the Image Studio to crop an image to a size recommended by the social channel, or to a custom size. When you crop an image in the Studio, you (temporarily) modify it, though the original image content is always stored. When you no longer need the modified image, re-open it in the Studio, and the original (whole) image appears for you to resize and use again. Only one instance (copy) of an image is available; you cannot save multiple instances (copies) of an image using the Image Studio. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From within a folder or the All Assets view, click on an asset. A panel containing the asset and its properties appears on the right-hand side. </li>
            <li>Click <b>More Actions</b> &gt;  <b>Edit in Image Studio</b>.</li>
            <li>Select a channel (or Custom) and click the circled chevron icon. A list of placement options (and associated sizes, in pixels) for the channel appears (such as Timeline, Cover Photo, and the like on Facebook). </li>
            <li>Select the intended publishing location; a “crop” box appears over the image. Move it so that it contains the part of the image you want to keep. You can also shrink or enlarge the image area by dragging the handles at the corners of the image box. Click <b>Apply</b>. (To undo the crop, click <b>Reset Image</b>.)</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save Changes</b>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you are done with a cropped image, you can open it again in the Image Studio, and it will reappear in its original, full size.</p>
