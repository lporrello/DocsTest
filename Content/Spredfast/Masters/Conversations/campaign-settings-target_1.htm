        <h1>Targeting Profiles</h1>
        <p>Create Facebook Targeting Profiles (Gated and Enhanced), and restrict users so that they can publish only to specified profiles.<MadCap:keyword term="Targeting: profiles; Users: restricting Targeting for; Facebook: targeting profiles." /></p>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.tooltips">
            <p><b>Enhanced targeting</b>—The post appears in targeted fans’ news feeds; everyone can see the post in the page’s Timeline. <br /><b>Gated targeting</b>—The post appears in targeted fans’ news feeds, and appears on the page’s Timeline only to targeted fans. </p>
            <p>For more information about Gated and Enhanced targets, and adding Facebook targets when creating a message, refer to the User Guide. </p>
        </div>
        <p>For more about Gated and Enhanced targets, and adding Facebook targets when creating messages, see <MadCap:xref href="Targeting.htm">Targeting</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><b>Targeting profiles</b> allow you to save commonly used targeting configurations. Targeting profiles are created and managed at the Initiative level. Once you create a profile, you can specify users that will be restricted (“constrained”) to it. </p>
        <p>By default, a user has no restrictions (“No constraints”) until an admin limits her profile usage. A non-constrained user can choose any defined targeting profile, or no targeting profile, when creating a Facebook message. If the user has been restricted to just one profile, that profile is <b>automatically applied</b> when the user selects a Facebook page account. If the user has been restricted to a set of profiles, only those profiles appear as options on the Targeting menu during message creation, and the user must select one of them.<b> If the user has been restricted to one or more profiles, the user cannot publish to the page</b> <b>without</b><b style="font-style: normal;"> using a profile.</b> If a user has no constraints (but is not an admin), she can add her own targeting to a message when creating it, but cannot save the target as a profile for others to use. Only users with Edit Initiative permission can create and save targeting profiles. </p>
        <p>Editing or deleting a profile (or changing the users that are restricted to it) has no effect on existing messages; the messages will use the profile definitions (and restrictions) that were in place when it was created. This is because the message retains the characteristics of the profile (location, language, gender, etc.), rather than the association with the profile itself, when it is put on the agenda. </p>
