        <h1>Agenda</h1>
        <p>The Agenda shows all messages for the Initiative, scheduled and published. Items in the Agenda have both a collapsed and an expanded view; to switch between them, click the + icon that appears beneath the message’s name. To expand all agenda items, click Expand All in the upper right-hand corner of the Agenda tab.</p>
        <p>The Agenda view defaults to the current day; you can switch days by clicking the links at the top of the page. You can also scroll through items within the Agenda view.</p>
        <p>You can process messages from the Agenda; appropriate buttons are provided based on the status of the message and the role of the user. For messages that have already been published, click the magnifying glass icon to see Message Details. For scheduled messages, click the pen icon to edit the content or schedule of the message, or the trash icon to delete. You can also make a copy of a message from the Agenda. If the message requires approval, and you are a member of one of the approval teams, the agenda entry provides Approve/Reject buttons so that you can process the item. If labels or notes have been added to the message, links to them are provided as well. You can “star” an item that is of interest to you, then use the Basic filter to find all items you have marked with a star. </p>
