        <h1>Streams</h1>
        <p>If you have the ability to create streams, you can create as many as you want. All available streams are listed in the Stream Library, but no data is shown for a stream until it is included in a tab, either as a stand-alone stream or as part of a Collection. When you create a stream, all others associated with the Initiative can use it. </p>
        <p>The following types of streams are used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Account-based</b>—Collect information from your existing social media accounts, like your Twitter account, Facebook page, or LinkedIn Group. In most cases, you can also specify the kinds of items you want to see in the stream (e.g. Twitter mentions versus direct messages). You must have these accounts authenticated within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, and users must have access to the account in order to see the stream.</li>
            <li><b>Search Streams</b>—Supports simple or advanced searching. If you select more than one channel, a separate stream is created for each one. Only Search streams can be edited. Sentiment streams using Social Mention are included as search streams. </li>
            <li><b>RSS Streams</b>—Collect from any RSS feed; these are especially useful for industry blogs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Twitter-Users: Follow content from lists of Twitter accounts. </p>
