        <p>If no other user has already accepted a highlighted stream, you can “accept” an item that has been highlighted for you (either specifically for you or for a highlight team you’re a member of). Once you accept an item, you can either “release” it, to make it available for someone else to accept. Or, after you have appropriately responded to the item, you can archive it. </p>
