        <h1>Duration Data</h1>
        <p>The Duration Data tab contains a time-based summary of how quickly your users (as a group) responded to Inbox items. The Average Durations chart shows the average response time for each user per date, as well as the weekly average. The Duration by Configuration shows the average response time for each user per date, but is grouped together by the relevant Care Configuration. A median and average for the day is shown in the bottom two rows. Any time over 1 day is highlighted in red. Click any items to see additional details.</p>
