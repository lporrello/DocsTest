        <h1>All Assets Folder</h1>
        <p>The All Assets folder shows all the assets that you have access to based on your Content Center role and on folder sharing rules. </p>
        <p>Within the All Assets folder, if you want to act on multiple assets at once, you must have the ability to take the action on all the assets you’ve selected; the system defaults to the <b>minimum level of permission</b> when working with multiple assets in this folder. For example, if you have selected three assets, and, due to the folder sharing rules, you have edit permissions and on one, and move plus copy permission on all three, the system will only display the “Move” action icon, because that is the only action common to all three selected assets. The actions you have available to you based on your role are shown in the <b>Management</b> bar. if a folder setting is limiting you for a selected asset, the button will be grayed out. </p>
