        <h1>Microblog Series<MadCap:keyword term="Series messages: creating" /></h1>
        <p>The Series feature allows you to create empty “shells” of a single (microblog) message, schedule them, and assign others to write content for them. It’s an easy way to set up messages that will have different content on a regular schedule. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Difference between Microblog Series and Repost</b>
            <br />“Repost” sends the same (identical) message multiple times. Microblog “Series” sends different content on a repeating schedule. </p>
