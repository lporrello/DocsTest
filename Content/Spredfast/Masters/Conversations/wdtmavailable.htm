        <h1>Available Account</h1>
        <p>For an account to appear in this list, it must exist on the social channel (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), have been <b>authenticated</b> within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />, and you must have access to the Account Set associated with the account.</p>
        <p>To <b>authenticate</b> a social media account in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" /> means to provide credentials (such as user name/password) so that you can use <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> to take actions that you would ordinarily take on the channel itself (such as posting, commenting, responding, and the like). </p>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />, a <b>Account Set </b>is a collection of social media accounts. When you are set up as a user in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, your administrator gives you access to appropriate Account Sets. </p>
        <p>To learn more about authentication and Account Sets in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, refer to the User Guide. </p>
