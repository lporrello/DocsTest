        <h1>Create Messages</h1>
        <p>For the four microblog types (Facebook posts, Google+ posts, Twitter tweets, and LinkedIn updates) use the channel-specific icons at the top of the screen. Note that users in the writer role now have permission to create microblogs (but not other message types). Writers do not have permission to publish any type of message. To create any other type of message, click the drop-down arrow next to the microblog icons, and select the message type. </p>
        <p>We’ve made it easier to create and manage sets of messages, as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to schedule multiple posts of the same content to publish at different times on the same channel, use the Repost feature. There must be a minimum of 24 hours (plus five minutes) between reposts. </li>
            <li>If you want to schedule multiple posts of different content to publish at the same time on different days on the same channel, use the Series feature, available from the drop-down menu next to the channel icons. </li>
            <li>If you want to reuse identical (or similar) content on different channels, use the new Copy Message button, available after you have created a message. </li>
            <li>If you want to create a bunch of messages in a spreadsheet (CSV), then import them into <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, use the Message Importer.</li>
            <li>While building a message, you can now switch channels “on the fly”—start composing a message in one channel screen and switch to another before you’re finished; all parts of the message that are common to both channels are populated, and if you switch back to the original screen, the channel-specific parts have been retained.</li>
        </ul>
