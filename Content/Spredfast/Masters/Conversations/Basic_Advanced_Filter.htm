        <h1>Basic/Advanced Filter</h1>
        <p>The Basic filter includes the most commonly used filter criteria, (such as channel, status, star status, and “assigned to me”) while the Advanced search lets you find items using just about any criteria. You can use Basic and Advanced filters together; selections you make and Apply in the Basic filter are remembered in the Advanced filter.</p>
        <p>You can save, name, and reuse filters. From the Advanced Filter screen, build a filter, then in the lower left hand corner of the panel, click Save, and provide a name. The saved filter is per user, and also per screen; filters you create in Calendar, for example, are not available in the Inbox. Your list of saved filters appears at the top of the Advanced Filter screen. Whenever a filter is on, a message next to the Basic filter displays “Filter ON.” To turn a filter off, click the Basic filter, and in the lower left-hand corner of the panel, click Turn Filter Off. </p>
