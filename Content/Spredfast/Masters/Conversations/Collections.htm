        <h1>Collections</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Streams: Collections; Collections: about" />A Collection stream combines several individual streams into a “super stream.” The following rules apply to Collections: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An individual stream can be a part of many users' Collections.</li>
            <li>A user can have an unlimited number of Collections, and each Collection can contain an unlimited number of streams. However, the Primary Collection, Highlighted, All Activity, Recent Engagement and Deleted/Hidden streams cannot be placed into a Collection.</li>
            <li>There are two types of Collections: Private and Shared. Private Collections are user-specific; only the user who creates them can see them or edit them. Shared Collections are created and managed by users whose Workspace assignment allows them to add streams; they can be seen by any user in the Initiative. Private Collections are represented by a folder icon; Shared Collections are represented by an icon of a folder with an ellipsis inside. </li>
            <li>If a user is allowed to add streams, he can change his Private Collection into a Shared Collection.</li>
            <li>Once a Shared Collection is made available, each user can decide whether to include it in a tab.</li>
            <li>A Shared Collection can be edited, made private, or deleted by any other user with a Workspace that allows him to add streams.</li>
            <li>Within the Stream Library you can see the relationship between streams and Collections. On each Collection icon, the number of streams is shown; roll over it to get a list of the streams the Collection contains. </li>
            <li>Like items in the Primary Collection, items displayed in a collection can be seen in the collection for 90 days. To see items older than 90 days, you must look in the source (constituent) stream separately. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Create a Private Collection<MadCap:keyword term="Collections: create Private; Private Collection" /></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Stream Library</b> menu, select <b>Create Collection</b>. The <b>Create Collection</b> screen appears. </li>
            <li>Enter a name for the Collection.</li>
            <li>Drag streams from the All Streams column into the target area in the Collection list to add them. </li>
            <li>Click <b>Done</b>. The Collection is created and appears in the All Streams section of the Stream Library. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once a Collection is created, you can add it to tabs as you can with other streams. If you delete a Collection, the individual streams that comprised the Collection are not deleted; they remain available for use. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.tooltips">For information on creating Private and Shared Collections, refer to the User Guide.</p>
