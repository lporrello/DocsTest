        <h1>Activity Metrics</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Metrics types: activity" />Activity metrics consist of data the system captures internally about user actions such as counts of posts, tweets, comments, photos, videos, and the like. It is updated and displayed every three hours. </p>
        <p>If activity was auto-imported from an external source (such as Facebook or Twitter), its data is included in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> metrics at least twice a day. Activity metrics are imported at the same time that content and credential metrics are collected from a social channel, as described below. </p>
        <h2>Posting to Multiple Accounts</h2>
        <p>Within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you can publish an item to multiple accounts at the same time. For example, you can post the same message to three separate Facebook accounts. In calculating metrics, the system would consider this one Facebook post, not three. </p>
