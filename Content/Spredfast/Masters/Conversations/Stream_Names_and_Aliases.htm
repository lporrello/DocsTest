        <h1>Stream Names and Aliases<MadCap:keyword term="Streams: names and aliases" /></h1>
        <p>By default, newly created streams are given names according to their types and characteristics (such as [<b>Facebook Page Name</b>: <b>Page Activity</b>, or <b>Search: apples</b> for a search stream using the term “apples”). The name of a stream can be changed permanently by renaming it, or temporarily, by giving it an “alias.” </p>
        <p>Any user can give a stream an alias. An alias is a unique, temporary name for a stream (in a tab) that’s assigned by an individual user. It is seen only by the user who creates it, and is forgotten when the stream is removed from its active tab. (An aliased stream can be moved from one tab to another, however.) An alias helps a user distinguish between multiple instances of the same stream within a single tab (such as when different filters have been applied to each one, for example, and the user needs to tell them apart). To give a stream an alias, click on the tab (so that the stream is visible), click on the stream’s name in the header, and provide a new name. Once created, the alias appears in the stream’s header, and in the tab’s list of streams in the Stream Library.<MadCap:keyword term="Streams: aliases in; Alias (stream name)" /> </p>
        <p>To rename a stream is to provide a new, permanent, universal name for the stream that appears to all users in the Initiative (once they refresh the page). To rename a stream, find the stream in the <b>All Streams</b> section of the Stream Library, click on the name, and provide a new one. The new name appears in all locations, for all users, (unless a user has aliased the stream in a tab). <MadCap:keyword term="Streams: rename; Rename stream" /></p>
        <p>You can also rename a stream when it is first created (shown as “added” in the <b>Added Streams</b> section of the <b>Add Streams</b> dialog). Click the <b>Edit stream name</b> (pen) icon to the left of the stream name, then in the <b>Rename</b> field, provide a new name for the stream and click <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Sysomos or Synthesio Streams</b>
            <br />When multiple streams are created, they populate with the name, "[Vendor name] Query Stream". To ensure that stream names are not identical, you can create an alias for each stream. To do this, click on the stream name in the Stream Library and then give the stream a unique name.</p>
