        <h2>Audience Size (Summary)</h2>
        <p>The sum of audience members (Facebook Friends/Fans, Google+ Followers, Twitter Followers, Instagram Followers, Weibo Followers, Pinterest Followers, LinkedIn Connections/Followers, and YouTube Channel Subscribers) for all accounts in the Initiatives. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current date range to the data from the prior (equivalent) date range. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account.

Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account.These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Engagement (Summary)</h2>
        <p>Engagement is the sum (count) of all engagement received by messages published during the date range, for all accounts in the Initiatives. Engagement consists of: All Bitly or BudURL clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Favorites, Replies and Retweets, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Comments, and Likes, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current date range to the data from the prior (equivalent) date range. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period.

Click on the channel to see the same data for each account.These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Date range reflects time of message publication</b>
            <br />The date range defines when the message was published, not when the engagement was received. For example: you published a message a month ago. If you filter the data based on the week you published the message, the results return all engagement activity received for the message, over the entire month. This is because some messages, such as videos, can take a long time for their maximum engagement to be achieved.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>No Engagement Metrics for Native Retweets</b>
            <br />Though “native” Retweets posted through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> are counted as publishing activity in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, engagement metrics are not available for them. (From Twitter’s perspective, a native Retweet is an additional instance of the original tweet, not a separate tweet that can have independent, measurable engagement. Any engagement on the Retweet would be credited to the original Tweet.) <br />So if you post a “native” Retweet using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, and other people engage with the retweet, that engagement is not counted. Consequently, Average Engagement ratios may be skewed. If you must have engagement metrics on all retweets published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />, limit users to Editable Retweets only. </p>
