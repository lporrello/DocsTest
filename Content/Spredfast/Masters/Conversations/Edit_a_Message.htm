        <h1>Edit a Message<MadCap:keyword term="Edit: messages; Messages: editing" /></h1>
        <p>The pen icon (Edit) appears only before the message is published, and only to users who have appropriate permissions to edit the content and/or the schedule of a message. If the message requires approvals, and a user makes changes to the content, publishing accounts (Account Sets, credentials, retweet credentials), approvals list, or schedule before it is published, the message has to go through the entire approval process again. Users can make changes to the message title, assignee, targeting, labels, and notes without causing a re-start of the approval process.</p>
        <p>To stop a microblog message (in Pending Publication status) before it publishes, click <b>Edit</b> and <b>Save as Draft</b> to return the message to Draft status. The message will have to go through the approval process again.<MadCap:keyword term="Messages: stopping before publication" /> </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>For (microblog) Messages:</b> Click the pen icon (Edit). The same screen used to create the message appears, and you can perform all editing/scheduling tasks within it. </li>
            <li><b>For all other Message Types:</b> Hover over pen icon, and click either <b>Edit Content</b> or <b>Edit Schedule</b>.</li>
