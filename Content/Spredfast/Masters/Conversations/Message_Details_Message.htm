        <h1>Message</h1>
        <p>The Message tab provides the content of the message, labels, notes and the complete activity log. You can add labels, notes, and depending on the channel, take some actions such as viewing on the native channel. </p>
        <p>When a message is deleted using the <b>Message</b> tab, all associated metrics are removed from the Account Sets/accounts used to publish the message. The message is NOT deleted from the channel on which it was published; for example, removing a Facebook post using the <b>Message</b> tab only removes the message from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />; it does NOT remove the message from Facebook.</p>
