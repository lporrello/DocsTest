        <h2>Engagement by Label: Label Aggregation</h2>
        <p>The labels applied to the best-performing messages, based on average engagement. Includes the number of messages that used the labels and the amount of engagement (average and count) received by the messages. A blank in the Label field indicates that no label was used. A message may appear in multiple counts if it has multiple labels applied to it. Click on the label name, average engagement, engagement count, or # of Messages value to see a table of the messages that comprise the data. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Engagement by Label: Top Labels by Average Engagement by Channel</h2>
        <p>Bar graph for each channel shows average engagement for messages containing each label; rollover a colored section of the bar graph to see the label name and the average engagement received by messages that included it; click on the section to see the engagement data for each message. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Top Messages by Engagement</h2>
        <p>The top 50 individual messages based on the amount of engagement (count) they received, across all accounts in the Initiatives. (Note that when there are duplicates of a message in the list, it often means the message was published through multiple Initiatives.) Click on the Message text field to see the Initiatives the message was published in; then click the Message ID entry to go to the Message Details page. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
