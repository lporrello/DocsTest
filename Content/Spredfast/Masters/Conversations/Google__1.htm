        <h2>Comment</h2>
        <p>You can add a simple comment by clicking the <b>Comment</b> icon, typing in the content field, and clicking <b>Comment</b>. <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> will use the account that originally created the stream to publish it. Or, click the <b>More options</b> button to use an expanded set of publishing features (other accounts, scheduling, notes, labels, etc.) for your post.</p>
        <h2>Delete from Google+<MadCap:keyword term="Delete: Google+ post" /></h2>
        <p>Google+ page administrators can delete posts and comments on posts. Deleted items are marked with a deleted (trash can) and added to the Hidden/Deleted stream. In situations when the items cannot be deleted from their native platform using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you have the option to mark them “deleted” using <b>Delete on Spredfast</b>, so that <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> displays them in the Hidden/Deleted stream for tracking purposes.</p>
