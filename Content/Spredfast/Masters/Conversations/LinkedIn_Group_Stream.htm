        <h1><a name="top"></a>LinkedIn Group Streams</h1>
        <p>To create a LinkedIn Group stream, there must be an authenticated Linkedin Account configured within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, and the account must be a member of one or more Linkedin Groups. When you authenticate a Linkedin account for <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />, you select which of its groups should be made available to the system.</p>
        <p>All posts to the LinkedIn Group are automatically included in the stream. Comments appear if the creator posted the topic, interacted with the post (replied to it) or clicks the star icon for the post within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Posts to Moderated LInkedIn Discussions</b>
            <br />Due to a limitation in the LinkedIn API, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> cannot obtain non-click metrics or comments for posts made to moderated LinkedIn Group discussions. </p>
        <p>From within the stream, users who are Linkedin Group administrators (owners, managers, or moderators) can delete comments from LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>See a Linkedin Group member's profile, current position information (from up to three companies the member currently works at), and company information by clicking on the user's avatar within the stream. </p>
