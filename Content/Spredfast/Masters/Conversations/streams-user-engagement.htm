The items generating the engagement must have either been created in the system or auto-imported. Other, “non-actionable” engagement metrics for the items (such as impressions) can appear in the Details drawer, but receipt of these types of engagement does not cause an item to appear in this stream. You can take action on items in this stream such as adding labels and viewing the item in the <b>Item Details</b> screen.</p>
