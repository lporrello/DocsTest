        <h1>Process Multiple Stream Items<MadCap:keyword term="Streams: process multiple items in; Inbox: process multiple items in" /></h1>
        <p>The multiple items processing menu at the top of each stream column enbables you to take action on multiple items in the stream.</p>
        <p>To identify items to process: For each item, hover over the upper left-hand corner of the item. Click the check icon that appears--it turns blue when the item has been selected. To select all currently visible items, click the <b>Select All</b> checkbox at the top of the stream. Then click the drop-down list to display available actions. Depending on the type of stream, these can include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>applying a macro to the items</li>
            <li>highlighting the items for other users (the users must have workspaces that allow access to the Inbox)</li>
            <li>adding labels to the items</li>
            <li>adding notes to the items</li>
            <li>marking the items as read (An item is automatically marked “read” if a user performs any action on it.)</li>
            <li>archiving the items (the Primary Collection stream archive is for all users in the Initiative; the Highlighted stream archive is user-specific).</li>
            <li>identifying authors of the items as Influencers</li>
            <li>accepting/releasing items (from the Highlighted stream)</li>
        </ul>
