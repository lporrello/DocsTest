        <h1>Accounts and Account Sets</h1>
        <p>Compare Audience Size, Activity, and Engagement. Metrics are refreshed daily. </p>
        <h2>Audience Size</h2>
        <p>The sum of audience members (Facebook Friends/Fans, Google+ Followers, Twitter Followers, Instagram Followers, Weibo Followers, Pinterest Followers, LinkedIn Connections/Followers, and YouTube Channel Subscribers) for accounts in scope. The graph shows the trend in audience count over the date range; click on a data point to see the sum for each channel on a specific day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current date range to the data from the prior (equivalent) date range. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p>30 day period: The sum of audience membership as of the last day in the date range. Click the number (link) to see audience size per account. </p>
        <p>Prior 30 days: The sum of audience membership as of the last day of the equivalent preceding time period. </p>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>The sum of all messages (Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest (Pins) Weibo, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube) published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported over the date range. The graph shows the trend in publishing activity over the date range; click on a data point to see messages published on each specific day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p>30 day period: The sum of messages published or auto-imported within the selected date range. Click the number (link) to see the list of messages. </p>
        <p>Prior 30 days: The sum of messages published or auto-imported in the equivalent preceding time period. </p>
        <h2>Engagement</h2>
        <p>The sum of engagement received (at any time) on all messages published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" /> or auto-imported over the date range. (Engagement includes all Bitly and BudURL clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses.)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Click on a data point to see engagement values for each message published that day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period.</li>
            <li>Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</li>
            <li>30 day period: The sum of engagement received on messages published or auto-imported within the selected date range. </li>
            <li>Click the number (link) to see the list of messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prior 30 days: The sum of engagement received on messages published or auto-imported in the equivalent preceding time period. </p>
        <h2>Return on Activity (Accounts)</h2>
        <p>Return on Activity is a visual representation of the amount of engagement received in relation to the amount of publishing activity that has been performed. </p>
        <p>To create this chart, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> counts the engagement received by messages in scope, and identifies the five top-performing accounts. The accounts are placed on the chart according to the amount of engagement they have received and the number of messages they have published. The comparative size of an account’s data point (sphere) on the chart indicates the account’s Audience Size—larger circles mean higher audience counts, smaller circles indicate lower audience counts. Accounts that appear in the upper left quadrant achieved the highest Return on Activity—the most engagement for the least amount of publishing. Accounts in the lower right quadrant yielded lower Return on Activity—less engagement from larger amounts of published content.</p>
        <p>Click on an account within the chart to see a list of messages the account published, and the engagement each message received.To see audience size, engagement, and activity data for all accounts in scope, click the View All X Accounts link in the upper right corner of the chart. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.tooltips">Return on Activity (Accounts) shows a comparative representation of account performance, based on the amount of engagement received per amount of publishing performed. </p>
        <p>The chart comprises the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engagement includes all Bitly clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses.</li>
            <li>Activity includes all messages and media (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Weibo, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube) published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported.</li>
            <li>Audience Size includes Facebook Friends/Fans, Google+ Followers, Twitter Followers, Instagram Followers, Pinterest Followers, Weibo Followers, LinkedIn Connections/Followers, and YouTube Channel Subscribers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Most Engagement (Accounts)</h2>
        <p>Compare the five top-performing accounts (based on engagement). Looking horizontally across a category (Audience Size, Activity, or Engagement) the charts provide side-by-side comparisons of the five top-performing accounts over the date range.To see the relationship between audience size, activity, and engagement for a single account, look at the charts in the three categories together vertically (Audience Size, Activity, and Engagement). Because the date ranges on the graphs are aligned, you can see trends in engagement and audience size and map them to changes in activity. To see Audience Size, Activity, or Engagement data for all of the accounts in scope, click the links in the top right of the chart. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Chart Alignment and Publishing Activity</b>
            <br />In most cases, the three charts (Audience Size, Activity, Engagement) are aligned so that trends are evident. However, in cases where few messages (or no messages) were published over the date range, the width (span) of the graphs will be different, so the charts may not align.</p>
