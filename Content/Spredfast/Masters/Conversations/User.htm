        <h1>User</h1>
        <p>The User tab compares a single user's performance to an entire group's performance. Select a user from the Single User drop-down, then select any number of users from the Comparing to group of users drop-down.</p>
        <p>The # Labeled Items is the total number of inbound items this user has applied labels to. The Total Responses only includes inbound items that the user issued responses too. Both of these metrics include the percent of the total number of stream items for this time period.</p>
        <p>The Average 24/7 First Response and Average Business First Response panes show the time between when the item was created and when the agent clicks Reply, not&#160; necessarily when the response is published. The group average response time is shown below as well as the users percentage of change from the group.</p>
        <p>Each metric has a comparison pane for the current period, previous period, and percentage of period-over-period change. Select a different time period by using the Date Range drop-down menu. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. Click the value for any period to see an itemized list of responses. Click the percentage to see each user’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage).</p>
