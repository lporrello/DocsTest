        <p>If an item has an identifiable author, click on the avatar to see the author's Social Profile. The profile will contain the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any available biographical data included on their social network profile (such as a Klout score)</li>
            <li>The history of <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> interaction with the user</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> notes that have been added to the author. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose to add the author to the Initiative's list of Influencers, “follow” the author (for Twitter), or go to the author’s profile on the social channel. <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> displays the avatar of the account used to interact with the profile. </p>
        <p>When an author is identified as an influencer, a gold circle appears around the author’s avatar. When notes about the author are added, an icon appears beneath the avatar. </p>
