        <h1>Initiative Explorer</h1>
        <p>Within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, metrics are divided into types. A metric’s type determines how it is calculated, how often it is updated, and how it is used. The system uses these types to classify metrics: activity, content, credential, sentiment, and external analytics. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Time Zones for Metrics</b>
            <br />For analytics data, Central Time is used to determine days, weeks, and months as follows. Other time zones set in <b>My Account</b> &gt; <b>Time Zone</b> are not supported. <br /><b>Day</b>—midnight Central Time<br /><b>Week</b>—Saturday night/Sunday morning (midnight) Central Time<br /><b>Month</b>—1st of the month at midnight Central Time<br />Consequently, if your time zone is not set to Central Time, you may see dates in the drop-down menus that do not match the date in the grid.</p>
        <p>Initiative-level information is provided both on the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_dashboard" />, where your most critical data is presented in chart form for quick review, and on the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_explorer" /> view screens, where you can dive more deeply into Initiative data collected by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_explorer" /> data displays are organized into these general categories: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Activity</b>—Measures the amount of content you are distributing through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> to your social media channels. This includes counts of posts, updates, photos, slide shows, tweets, and videos. </li>
            <li><b>Reach</b>—Counts the number of people your Initiative affects. This data includes both your current network (sometimes referred to as direct audience) and potential impressions (sometimes referred to as indirect audience). Current network numbers include friends, fans, followers, mentions, views, downloads, subscribers, and connections. Potential impression numbers are derived from network members' follower count: they are the people who could potentially see a mention or a retweet made by a network member.</li>
            <li><b>Engagement</b>—Counts the number of actions your audience takes on the content you publish. This includes click-throughs, comments, likes, replies, retweets, and ratings of an item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The contents of the Initiative Explorer depend on what accounts you have authenticated. Data presented in the Detailed Analytics view is a sum of the metrics for all the authenticated accounts in all the Account Sets across the Initiative. If you want to see data for a specific account or a specific Account Set, use the filters to obtain that data. </p>
        <p>For most views, the default data collection range is seven days. Change the date range using the calendar pickers. Choose increments of time using the Day or Week drop-down menu. The system automatically adjusts the ranges to complete weeks and months. For example, if you set the date range to begin on Monday, January 2nd and end on Friday, January 27th, and choose to view the data by Week, the date range automatically expands the range to begin on Sunday, January 1st and end on Saturday, January 28th, so that a full four weeks of data are provided. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Export: metrics data" />Analytics data that is currently active in the page can downloaded in a CSV file by clicking <b>Export</b>. You can change or limit the data to export by applying a Filter or selecting a new date range. </p>
        <p>Within the Initiative Explorer, you can click on any highlighted metric to retrieve specific items reflected in the metrics, such as engagement items or action items. </p>
