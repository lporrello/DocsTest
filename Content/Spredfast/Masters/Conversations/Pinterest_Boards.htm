        <h2>Boards by Engagement</h2>
        <p>The Pinterest Boards that performed the best in the selected Initiatives, based on the engagement (Repins, Likes and comments) they received on pins published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> and auto-imported over the date range. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Repin Return on Activity</h2>
        <p>Repin Return on Activity is a visual representation of the amount of sharing (Repin engagement) received in relation to the amount of publishing activity that has been performed. </p>
        <p>To create this chart, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> counts the engagement (Repins) received by pins in scope, and identifies the five top-performing Boards. The Boards are placed on the chart according to the amount of Repins they have received and the number of pins they have published. The comparative size of an Board’s data point (sphere) on the chart indicates the Board’s Audience Size—larger circles mean higher audience counts, smaller circles indicate lower audience counts. Boards that appear in the upper left quadrant achieved the highest Repin Return on Activity—the most Repin engagement for the least amount of publishing. Boards in the lower right quadrant yielded lower Repin Return on Activity—less engagement from larger amounts of published pins.</p>
        <p>Click on a Board within the chart to see a list of pins the account published, and the Repin engagement each pin received.To see audience size, engagement, and activity data for all Boards in scope, click the View All X Boards link in the upper right corner of the chart.
