        <h1>Weekly</h1>
        <p>On the Weekly tab, compare the number of inbound items your users responded to week-over-week. The chart shows the value for each day based on business hours and 24/7 hours, as well as the total for each week. The response time values in the Total column are averages of the weekly response times. Click on the value for any day to view an itemized list of content that received responses, links to the Item Details, the labels applied and response times. Adjust the date in single week increments by clicking on the Date Range drop-down menu.</p>
