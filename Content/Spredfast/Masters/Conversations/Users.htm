        <h1>Users</h1>
        <p>See all users within the environment, deactivate users, export list of users. (The view into environment depends on which Internal Admin role you have.)</p>
        <p>Users cannot be permanently deleted from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />. Instead, they are deactivated. Deactivated users cannot log in, cannot be impersonated, do not receive system notifications, and are removed from all lists of users (such as approval teams and highlight teams). However, items assigned to a deactivated user remain assigned to that user. A user is reactivated if, when an admin adds him to the system, the same email address is used. The system recognizes the email and adds him back to the list of users. </p>
        <h2>Deactivate a User</h2>
        <p>Click <b>Deactivate</b>, and then click <b>Yes</b> to confirm. The user is removed from the list of Users. </p>
        <h2>Export a CSV List of Users</h2>
        <p>Click <b>Export</b>. The CSV contains First Name, Last Name, Email address, Default company name, and the date the user was added to the system. If you need a more detailed export, including role and company information, see <MadCap:xref href="Export_Users__Detailed_.htm">Export Users (Detailed)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
