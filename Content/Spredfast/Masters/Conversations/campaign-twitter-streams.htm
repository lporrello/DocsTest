        <h1>Twitter-Based Streams<MadCap:keyword term="Twitter: associate stream with account" /></h1>
        <p>Each Twitter search-based and Twitter Users stream must be associated with an authenticated Twitter account. Streams are associated with a Twitter account when they are created in the Inbox. There are limits to the number of streams allowed for each account, and you can change the account with which a stream is associated. </p>
        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="twitter_search_stream_he.htm">Twitter Admin Settings</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>The <b>Twitter-based streams</b> tab shows the allocation of accounts to Twitter streams <b>within the Initiative</b>. If an account has not been assigned to any streams in the Initiative, it appears twice in the table (once for each stream type) with “No assigned streams in this Initiative” shown in the <b>Stream</b> column. </p>
        <p>If you want to limit the number of streams an account can have of each type to a number <b>less than the configured maximum</b>, you can “lock” the account, so that no new streams of that type can be added to it. For example, if you have three search-based streams associated with an account, and the maximum permitted is six, you could “lock” the account at three, so that no more search-based streams could be added to the account. You could still add Twitter Users streams to the account; <b>locks are applied per stream type</b>. </p>
        <h2>Re-assign a Stream to a Twitter Account </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From <b>Initiative Settings</b>, click <b>Twitter-based Streams</b> tab. </li>
            <li>Find the stream you want to change, and click the checkbox.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Change account</b> drop-down, select a different account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Stream Counts Displayed in the Selector</b>
            <br />When you use the <b>Change Account</b> drop-down, the list of available accounts shows the number of streams currently assigned to the account <b>company-wide</b>, not for the Initiative. That’s why there may be a higher number shown in the dialog than the number of times the stream appears in the Twitter-based streams table, which is for the Initiative.</p>
        <h2>Re-assign Multiple Streams to an Account:<MadCap:keyword term="Twitter: reassign multiple streams to account" /> </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From <b>Initiative Settings</b>, click <b>Twitter-based Streams</b> tab. </li>
            <li>Click the checkbox to the left of each stream you want to change.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Change account</b>.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Change account</b> dialog, select a new account from the drop-down menu. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Lock a Twitter Account<MadCap:keyword term="Twitter: lock account (limit associated streams)" /></h2>
        <p> This will ensure that no more streams of the same type can be added.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From <b>Initiative Settings</b>, click <b>Twitter-based Streams</b> tab. </li>
            <li>Find a stream associated with the account you want to lock. </li>
            <li>Click the checkbox in the <b>Lock</b> column. All other streams of the same type associated with the account are automatically checked (and locked) as well. </li>
        </ol>
