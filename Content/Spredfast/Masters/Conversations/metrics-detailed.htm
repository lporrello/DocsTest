        <h1>Detailed Analytics</h1>
        <p>Expand the <b>Chart Item</b> menu to see the graph area. To add an item to the graph, click the checkbox next to it. If a count is underlined, you can click it to display the content items included in the count.</p>
        <h2>Total Reach</h2>
        <p>Counts the number of people your Initiative has affected. Current Network includes those who have “officially” joined your network by becoming a friend, fan, follower, and the like. Potential Impressions includes those who might have come into contact with your content through an act of sharing by a third party, such as a mention or a retweet. Combining Current Network and Potential Impressions provides a sense of the total number of people you reached, or could have reached, on a given day. Though there can be overlap between the categories, such is the nature of impression data. </p>
