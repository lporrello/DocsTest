        <p>Copy a (microblog) message from a different Initiative (indicated by the item’s name in italics) into your current Initiative. If the channel (account) used in the source message is not part of your current Initiative, a drop-down menu presents a list of available channels. The copy has the same labels, supplemental approvals and scheduling details as the original. The copied message is not associated with or linked to the source message in any way. </p>
