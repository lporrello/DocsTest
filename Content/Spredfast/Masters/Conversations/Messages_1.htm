        <h1>Messages</h1>
        <h2>Facebook Messages (Count)</h2>
        <p>The sum of messages (all types) published by all Facebook accounts (Profiles, Pages, Groups) in the Initiatives, over the date range. The number is the sum over the date range; click on it to see sums per account. The graph shows the trend in publishing activity over multiple weeks; click on a week’s data point to see messages published per account for that specific week. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Average Engagement</h2>
        <p>The number is the average engagement; the sum of all engagement (clicks on embedded Bitly or BudURL links, like stories, comment stories, share stories, other stories) received by all messages, divided by the number of messages posted. Click to see average engagement received by messages published by each account. The graph shows the trend in engagement activity over multiple weeks; click on a data point to see average engagement for each account. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p>Date range reflects time of message publication</p>
        <p>The date range defines when the message was published, not when the engagement was received. For example: you published a message a month ago. If you filter the data based on the week you published the message, the results return all engagement activity received for the message, over the entire month. This is because some messages, such as videos, can take a long time for their maximum engagement to be achieved.</p>
        <h2>Engagement Rate</h2>
        <p>Engagement rate (percentage) is the number of people who clicked on, liked, commented on, or shared a post (post_engaged_users) divided by the number of unique people who saw it (post_impressions_unique). Click on the percentage to see the numbers used to calculate it, for each account. The graph shows the trend over multiple weeks; click on a data point to see counts for each account during that week. This data is provided by Facebook.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Engagement Rate vs Average Engagement</b>
            <br />Average Engagement is a metric calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> that shows the amount of engagement received divided by the number of messages published. It is provided for all the channels in Company Analytics and helps users determine the relative return on activity for Account Sets, accounts and Initiatives. <br />Engagement Rate is a Facebook-specific, post-level metric, provided by Facebook. The actions that are considered “engagement” are different for each of these. Average Engagement (<MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />) counts clicks on embedded (Bitly or BudURL) links and Facebook Stories (like, comment, share, and others). Engagement Rate (Facebook) counts Stories, plus any type of click on the post (on embedded Bitly or BudURL link, poster’s profile, “more...” link, etc.).</p>
        <h2>Negative Feedback</h2>
        <p>The number is the sum of negative feedback (hide, hide all, report spam, unlike page, x button) received by all messages published during the date range by all Facebook accounts in the Initiatives. Click on it to see negative feedback received by messages published by each account. The graph shows the trend in negative feedback over multiple weeks; click on a week’s data point to see negative feedback received by each account during that week. This data is provided by Facebook. </p>
        <h2>Engagement by Type</h2>
        <p>The Engagement number is the sum of engagement (clicks and stories) received by all messages published during the date range by all Facebook accounts in the Initiatives; click on it to see the engagement sums per account. For each engagement type (Stories and Clicks), the top-level numbers represent the sums for all accounts; click on the number for each type to see engagement values of that type for each account. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Clicks</b>—Number of clicks made on (Bitly or BudURL) links embedded in messages published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported, for all Facebook accounts that are part of the Initiatives. This data is provided by Bitly or BudURL. </li>
            <li><b>Stories</b>—The sum of all post stories (created by user Likes, comments, and shares) on messages published by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported, for all Facebook accounts that are part of the Initiatives. This data is provided by Facebook. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Post Stories by Type</h2>
        <p>The Post Stories number is the sum for all post stories for all accounts; click it to see the breakdown by type, per account. The pie chart shows the types of stories created on messages posted during the date range. Click on a section of the chart to see the breakdown by account.</p>
        <h2>Post Stories by Negative Feedback</h2>
        <p>The Feedback number is the sum of negative feedback counts for all accounts; click it to see sums per account. The pie chart shows the types of stories created by negative feedback on messages. Click on a section of the chart to see the breakdown by account.

        <h2>Label Aggregation</h2>
        <p>The labels applied to the best-performing messages, based on average engagement. Includes the number of messages that used the labels and the amount of engagement (average and count) received by the messages. A blank in the Label field indicates that no label was used. A message may appear in multiple counts if it has multiple labels applied to it. Click on the label name, average engagement, engagement count, or # of Messages value to see a table of the messages that comprise the data. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Labels by Average Engagement</h2>
        <p>Bar graph shows proportional average engagement received by messages containing each label; rollover the colored bar to see label name and the average engagement received by messages that included it; click to see engagement received by each message. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Labels by Number of Messages</h2>
        <p>Bar graph shows proportional usage of each label; rollover the colored bar to see label name and the number of messages that included it; click to see the list of messages containing the label, and the engagement they received. Note that a blank in the Label Name field means no label was used. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Messages by Engagement</h2>
        <p>The top 50 individual messages based on the amount of engagement (count) they received, across all accounts in the Initiatives. (Note that when there are duplicates of a message in the list, it often means the message was published through multiple Initiatives.) Click on the Message text field to see the Initiatives the message was published in; then click the Message (ID) entry to go to the Message Details page. A dark moon icon in the Dark column means the message is an Unpublished Page Post (dark post). A pale moon means the message was created as a dark post, then subsequently published. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p>If you want to see more than 50 messages, use the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.message_explorer" />.</p>

        <h2>Insights: Post Day</h2>
        <p>The best day of the week to post messages on the channel based on the average engagement (engagement count divided by number of messages posted) for the date range. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
