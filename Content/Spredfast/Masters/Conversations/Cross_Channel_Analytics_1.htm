        <h1>Cross-Channel Analytics—Messages</h1>
        <p>This section covers channel analytics available for Messages.</p>
        <h2>Message Breakdown</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Total Messages</b>—The number of messages in scope published or auto-imported over the date range, with and without Labels.</li>
            <li><b>w/ Labels</b>—The number of messages that included selected Labels (if specific labels were chosen in the Label filter).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>The sum of all messages (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Weibo, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube) published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported over the date range. The graph shows the trend in publishing activity over the date range; click on a data point to see messages published on each specific day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p><b>30 day period</b>—The sum of messages published or auto-imported within the selected date range. </p>
        <p><b>Prior 30 days</b>—The sum of messages published or auto-imported in the equivalent preceding time period. </p>
        <h2>Engagement</h2>
        <p>The sum of engagement received (at any time) on all messages published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported over the date range. (Engagement includes all clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses.) The graph shows the trend in engagement received by messages published during that time. Click on a data point to see engagement values for each message published that day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). Click on the channel to see the same data for each account. These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <p>30 day period: The sum of engagement received on messages published or auto-imported within the selected date range. Click the number (link) to see the list of messages.</p>
        <p>Prior 30 days: The sum of engagement received on messages published or auto-imported in the equivalent preceding time period. </p>
        <h2>Return on Activity (Labels)</h2>
        <p>Return on Activity is a visual representation of the amount of engagement received in relation to the amount of publishing activity that has been performed. </p>
        <p>To create this chart, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> counts the engagement received by messages in scope that contained labels, and identifies the five labels associated with the most engagement. The labels are placed on the chart according to the amount of engagement they have received and the number of messages that contained them. In this chart, labels that appear in the upper left quadrant achieved the highest Return on Activity—the most engagement for the least amount of publishing effort. Labels in the lower right quadrant yielded lower Return on Activity—less engagement from larger amounts of published content.</p>
        <p>Click on a label within the chart to see the list of messages that contained it, and the engagement each message received. To see engagement and activity data for all messages in scope, click the View All X Labels link in the upper right corner of the chart. (Note that a blank entry in the Label Name column means that no label was used.) This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.tooltips">
            <h2>Return on Activity</h2>
            <p>Shows the “Return on Activity” for messages containing labels. </p>
            <p>Engagement includes all Bitly  or BudURL clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses. Activity includes all messages (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube) published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Message Focus</h2>
        <p>Message Focus is a visual representation of the distribution of messages and engagement they’ve received, by week, based on labels. Depending on your organization’s labeling scheme, use this chart to compare trends in the amount of publishing you performed, and engagement you received, on certain topics, message types, or other criteria, over multiple weeks. </p>
        <p>To create this chart, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> counts the labels applied to publishing activity in scope, and displays results for the five most frequently used labels. To see engagement and activity data for all messages in scope, click the View All X Labels link in the upper right corner of the chart. (Note that a blank entry in the Label Name column means that no label was used.) This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h3>Message Focus</h3>
        <p>Shows the distribution of publishing activity (through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, Weibo, and YouTube) for the five most frequently used labels among the messages in scope, by week. Click on the week (link) to see daily counts for each label, or click on a label’s section of the bar graph to see usage and engagement data for the label. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h3>Engagement of Message Focus</h3>
        <p>Shows the distribution of engagement received by messages containing the five most frequently used labels among the messages in scope, by week. Click on the week (link) to see daily engagement counts for each label, or click on a label’s section of the bar graph to see usage and engagement data for the label. (Engagement includes all Bitly  or BudURL clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses.)This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
        <h2>Most Engagement (Labels)</h2>
        <p>Provides a visual representation of trends in activity and engagement of the five top-performing Labels (by engagement). To compare labels’ usage and performance side-by-side (Label A compared to Label B), look at the charts horizontally within either category (Activity by Label or Engagement by Label). To examine the relationship between activity and engagement for a single label (only Label A) look at the label’s charts together vertically; because the date ranges on the graphs are aligned, you can map trends of activity to the engagement received. </p>
        <h3>Activity by Label</h3>
        <p>Compare the change in activity over the date range for the five top-performing Labels. Within a chart, click on a data point to see the list of messages that comprise it. Activity includes all messages (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Weibo, YouTube) published via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /> or auto-imported. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h3>Engagement by Label</h3>
        <p>Compare the change in engagement for messages published over the date range for the five top-performing Labels. Within a chart, click on a data point to see the list of messages that comprise it. Engagement includes all Bitly  or BudURL clicks, Facebook stories, Twitter Replies, Favorites, and Retweets, LinkedIn Likes, Comments, and Shares, Instagram Likes and Comments, Pinterest Repins, Likes, and Comments, Weibo Comments (including Replies) and Reposts, Google+ +1s, Reshares and Comments, YouTube Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favorites, and Video Responses. This data is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />.</p>
        <h3>Performance by Label</h3>
        <p>Provides activity and engagement breakdowns for messages in scope, sorted by engagement (count). </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Not all Engagement Types are Shown</b>
            <br />The number of available data columns is limited; some engagement types (such as YouTube Comments) that are included in the engagement count and average engagement calculations do not appear in this table.</p>
