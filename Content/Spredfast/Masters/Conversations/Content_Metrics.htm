        <h1>Content Metrics</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Metrics types: content; Engagement: metrics, defined; Reach: metrics, defined; Metrics: fetching, content" />Content metrics consist of data <b>about</b> published activity. Content metrics can be divided into two types: Engagement and Reach. Engagement metrics describe <b>audience actions</b> in response to published content. Reach metrics describe the <b>number of people</b> who have seen, or may have seen, published activity.</p>
        <p>Content metric data is provided by the various social channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, through the service’s API. The rate at which Content Metrics are fetched for an item depends on the age of the item: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Items three days old or less: metrics are fetched every hour.</li>
            <li>Items seven days old or less: metrics are fetched every three hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>LinkedIn Exception</b>
            <br />All LinkedIn content seven days old or less is fetched every 4 hours.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Items older than seven days: metrics are fetched at least once per day. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Content Metrics are collected up to 90 days after publishing, except for YouTube content, which is collected indefinitely. </p>
