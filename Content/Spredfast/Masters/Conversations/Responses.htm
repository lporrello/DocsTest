        <h1>Responses</h1>
        <p>The Responses tab calculates metrics around responses sent <b style="font-weight: normal;">from</b> Conversations. Responses sent natively and digested through auto-import are not included.</p>
        <p>The Total Responded to by Individual is the total number of messages divided by the number of responses sent from each user. Click any section to see an itemized list.</p>
        <p>The Responded to Trend chart is the number of items responded to plotted across a time axis. Click on a data point to see responses published on each specific day. The percentage change (up or down) is calculated by comparing the data from the current time period to the data from the prior (equivalent) time period. For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each channel’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage).</p>
        <p>The User Performance chart shows each user’s avatar and name, the number of responses they sent, their percentage of overall responses sent as well as their average response times.</p>
