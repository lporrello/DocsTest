        <h1>Cross-Channel Analytics—Social Care</h1>
        <p>The Social Care dashboards are designed to provide insight around inbound content and user response times. Set the business hours for your Social Care calculations from the Analytics tab.</p>
        <p>Response times are calculated as the time between an item’s creation and an agent submitting the reply. Any time spent in an approval is not factored into response time.</p>
