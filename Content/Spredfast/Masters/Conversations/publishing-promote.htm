        <h1>Promotion<MadCap:keyword term="Facebook: Newsfeed promotion; Promotion: add to a Facebook message; Facebook: content promotion" /></h1>
        <p>Pay to promote the message to your fans in the Newsfeed. You can promote to one Facebook Page account at a time. The message is published according to schedule, then the content is sent to Facebook for approval as a promotion. Once Facebook has approved the promotion, typically within 24 hours, it appears in the Newsfeed. If targeting was applied to the message when it was posted, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> applies the same targeting to the message when it is promoted. If no targeting is selected, the message is targeted to the top 25 countries.</p>
        <h2>Promotion on Multiple Messages</h2>
        <p>You can use the Promote feature on messages that are part of a Facebook Series; once the Series has been added, use the Edit (pen) from the Agenda entry to add a promotion to any message in the Series. The Promote feature cannot be used on Facebook messages created using the Repost feature. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.admin content">The <b>Promote</b> tab appears when the content promotion feature has been enabled for the company in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, a Facebook Page account has been configured for content promotion, and the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> user has permission to promote.</p>
