        <h1>Standard Streams</h1>
        <p>Standard streams in the system are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Primary Collection</b>—a collection of multiple streams determined to be the most important for the Initiative. Note that stream items are displayed/retained in the Inbox for 90 days. After 90 days, an item can be found by looking at its source stream separately. Use the drop-down menu next to the Inbox heading to filter the contents displayed in this stream for Archived (for the whole Initiative), Read, or Unread items. </li>
            <li><b>Highlighted</b>—a collection of items that have been highlighted for you, or that you have highlighted for someone else. Use the drop-down menu next to the Highlighted label to show items you have archived for yourself. </li>
            <li><b>All Activity</b>—a collection of all actions that have been published from the Initiative, from newest to oldest.</li>
            <li><b>Recent Engagement</b>—a collection of items published from the Initiative that have received the most recent actionable engagement.</li>
            <li><b>Hidden/Deleted</b>—a collection of items that have been deleted from their native platform using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, items marked as deleted within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />, items <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> identifies as deleted, and Facebook items that have been hidden on Facebook using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these standard streams, you can create custom groups of streams, called Collections.</p>
