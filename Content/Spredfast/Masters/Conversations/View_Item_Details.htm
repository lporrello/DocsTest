        <h1>View Item Details</h1>
        <p>To show the Item Details panels, you can... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click in any open area of a stream item</li>
            <li>Click on the <b>More Actions</b> menu and select <b>Item Details</b>, </li>
            <li>Click <b>View All</b> from within a Comment entry</li>
            <li>Click <b>View Conversation</b> from within a response entry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Item Details: Item</h2>
        <p>On the Item Details: Item page, you can see an audit trail (Log) of actions that <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> users have taken on the item, and notes <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> users have made. Each item that has already been responded to, or for which a response has been scheduled, is given a log entry.</p>
        <p>If the item is from a Brandwatch, Sysomos, or Synthesio stream, an additional pane appears below the Labels section. This pane contains the Brandwatch, Sysomos, or Synthesio data.</p>
        <p>The full set of item responses are available from the Item tab.</p>
        <h2>Item Details: Conversation</h2>
        <p>If a stream item is part of a conversation on a channel (part of a series of messages and replies), a bar appears at the top of the item that links to the <b>Conversation</b> tab. </p>
        <p>For channels other than Twitter, the <b>Conversation</b> tab shows the original message at the top of the stream, and the associated responses in chronological order. </p>
        <p>For Twitter, The <b>Conversation</b> tab contains all previous messages in the conversation, plus any messages that were published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>For Twitter, Previous Items Only</b>
            <br />The <b>Conversation</b> tab for Twitter shows items published <b>before</b> the current item (the one you used to access the <b>Conversation</b> tab) plus any items published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />; it cannot contain items (responses) published<b> after</b> the current item. To be sure that you see the entire conversation, you must be in the most recent item posted in the conversation. </p>
        <p>The <b>Conversation</b> tab can contain up to 10 items; if the thread is longer, an option to Load Earlier Conversation appears. You can change the order of the items by clicking <b>Newest on Top</b> or <b>Oldest on Top.</b></p>
        <p>Within the tab, the original message appears with a white background, and the current item (the one used to access the <b>Conversation</b> tab) appears with a dark gray background. </p>
        <p>From the bottom of each item, a channel-appropriate set of Response and Processing options are provided. For items published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, these options won’t appear until the message has published and brought into the app. </p>
