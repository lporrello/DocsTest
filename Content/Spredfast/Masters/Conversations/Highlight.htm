        <h1>Highlight<MadCap:keyword term="Highlight (stream item)" /></h1>
        <p>Highlighting a stream item for others in the Initiative lets them know that you think the item is of interest to them. The people for whom you highlight an item receive an email and reminders about the item, and the item appears in their (and your) Highlighted stream (see <MadCap:xref href="streams-highlighted.htm">Highlighted Stream</MadCap:xref>). A count of items that have been highlighted specifically for you appears in your To Do list.</p>
        <p>The Highlight feature can help teams of <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> users manage conversations. Items can be highlighted for individual users, or teams of users. When the item appears in the user’s Highlighted stream, the user can “accept” the item and take action on it. Once action has been completed, the user can “Archive” the item. </p>
        <p>For information on creating Highlight teams, see <MadCap:xref href="Highlight_Teams.htm">Highlight Teams</MadCap:xref>. </p>
