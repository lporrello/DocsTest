        <h1>Credential Metrics</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Metrics types: credential; Metrics: fetching, credential" />Credential metrics (also called account metrics) consist of data about a <b>specific account</b> within a social networking channel, such as the number of Facebook friends or number of Twitter followers the account has. Like content metrics, credential metrics are provided by the social channel via an API. These metrics are fetched at least once a day. </p>

            <p class="note"><b>“Change In” Metrics Calculations</b>
                <br />“Change in” metrics track the increase or decrease of audience members over a period of time. When an account is first added for monitoring (authenticated) in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, it may already have a number of followers, friends, fans, subscribers and the like associated with it. <br />If the “change in” metrics included these members the first time the data was collected from the new account, the value would spike, and provide a misleading view of the audience members added that first day. Consequently, the “change in” data is not calculated the first time data is collected for a new account. These audience members are included in the count of total audience members, however. Similarly, “change in” values are not calculated the last time data is collected for an account that has been de-authenticated. <br /><br />For example, if the account has 100 Twitter followers when you first authenticate it, the system does not indicate that you “added” 100 followers the first day the account was authenticated. Instead, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> uses the current count as a baseline, and then starts presenting the “change in” data each subsequent day that data is collected from the service. </p>
