        <h1>Add, Move, Remove Shared Bookmark<MadCap:keyword term="Bookmark: add, move, delete; Shared Bookmark" /></h1>
        <p>The shared bookmark helps users who work together in the Inbox manage transitions during shift changes or breaks in the workday. A user can mark a single item in each stream or shared collection with a bookmark icon that others in the Initiative can see. As shifts change or people resume work after a break, the stream location where work stopped can be easily identified. Following are some shared bookmark feature rules: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One bookmark is available for each shared collection or stream (except for the Archived view of the Primary Collection stream and the Highlighted stream, which is personal, not shared).</li>
            <li>All users in the Initiative can see the shared bookmark. </li>
            <li>Any user in the Initiative can add the bookmark to an item, move it to a different item, or delete it from an item.</li>
            <li>In the Primary Collection stream, if the item with the bookmark gets archived by a user, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> automatically moves the bookmark to the next item (more recent) in the Primary Collection stream. </li>
            <li>Once a bookmark has been added to an item in the stream, the <b>Jump to</b> menu at the top of the stream includes a “shared bookmark” option, so that any user in the Initiative can go directly to the bookmarked item. </li>
            <li>Deleting a stream or shared collection that has a bookmark applied in it deletes the bookmark.</li>
            <li>If the stream appears in multiple tabs, the bookmark’s location is maintained in all instances of the stream.</li>
            <li>If an applied filter causes the bookmarked item to be hidden (either because of a user-applied filter or the read/unread filter in the Primary Collection), the filter must be removed before the user can <b>Jump to</b> the bookmark. </li>
            <li>Hover over a bookmark to see who applied it, and when it was added or moved. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use a Shared Bookmark in the Inbox</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From within a stream item, click the <b>More actions</b> menu, and select <b>Add shared bookmark</b>. The bookmark icon appears in the upper right corner of the item.</li>
            <li>Once the bookmark has been set, any user in the Initiative can use the <b>Jump to</b> menu to find the item. Select <b>Jump to</b> &gt; <b>Shared bookmark</b>. </li>
            <li>Any user in the Initiative can move the bookmark to a different item within the stream, or delete it, using the <b>More actions</b> menu. </li>
        </ol>
