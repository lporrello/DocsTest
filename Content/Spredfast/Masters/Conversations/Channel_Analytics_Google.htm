        <h1>Channel Analytics—Google+</h1>
        <p>This section covers channel analytics available for Google+.</p>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.admin content">
            <p>Due to the way that Google+ provides data through their API, there are the following limits to metrics data and auto-import in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metrics are collected on only the 500 most recent Google+ posts to a page (approximately).</li>
                <li>Only the 200 most recent posts to a Google+ page are auto-imported (approximately).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These numbers are approximate because Google+ provides posts out of order. We might collect metrics for, or auto-import, older items instead of newer items in some cases. We will collect metrics for 500 and auto-import 200, but they may not always be precisely the most recent. </p>
