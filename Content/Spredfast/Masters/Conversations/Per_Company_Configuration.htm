        <h3>Enable <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.new_analytics" /> for a Company:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain permission from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> Product Management. </li>
            <li>From the Admin Panel, click <b>Companies</b>. </li>

            <li>Confirm presence of data in Message Explorers and Social Performance Dashboards. When the display and data content is acceptable, you can enable the feature for customers.</li>

        <h2>Message Delegation Enabled<MadCap:keyword term="Message Delegation (Admin Panel)" /></h2>

        <p>In the default state (OFF, or the “centralized” model), a single instance of a micro-blog message is created, follows the approval paths configured for the Account Sets associated with it, and must receive approval from all associated Account Sets in order to be published through any of the Account Sets. </p>
        <p>When enabled (turned ON, or the “hub and spoke” model), multiple instances of a message are created, one for each Account Set, and the message must receive approval only from the approval teams associated with that individual Account Set before being published. The instance of the message can be published as it was written, edited, or rejected regardless of what action is taken on the other instances of the message within the other Account Sets.</p>
