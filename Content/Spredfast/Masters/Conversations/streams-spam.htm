        <p>The following items can be <b>deleted</b> from their native platform via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facebook wall posts (and comments on those posts)</li>

        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="Respond_to_Stream_Items.htm">Respond to Stream Items</MadCap:xref> for more information on deleting items from each channel. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.tooltips">See the User Guide for more information on deleting items from each channel.</p>
        <p>When a user summons the All Comments dialog, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> compares the current content with the former content; if items are missing, it adds them to the Hidden/Deleted stream. </p>
        <p>In situations when the items cannot be deleted from their native platform using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you have the option to mark them “deleted” using the <b>Delete in Spredfast</b> button, so that <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" /> displays them in the Hidden/Deleted stream for tracking purposes. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.admin content"><b>Hidden/Deleted Stream Replaces Former Spam Stream</b>
            <br />Note that at the 4.05 release, the designation “Spam” was deprecated, and the Spam stream renamed to the Hidden/Deleted stream. Items that were marked as spam prior to 4.05 do not appear in the new Hidden/Deleted stream, unless they were also marked as Deleted. </p>
