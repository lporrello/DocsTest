        <h1>Initiative Explorer FAQ</h1>
        <p>Answers to the most common questions about Initiative-level metrics in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Why can’t I see the Initiative Explorer?</h2>
        <p>Most of the tabs and screens in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> are configurable—they must be enabled for you by an administrator before you can see and use them.</p>
        <h2>How often are Initiative Dashboard and Explorer metrics displays updated in the system?</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Metrics: refresh rate, Initiative data" />As a general rule, Initiative metrics data is updated in the system at least twice a day. Data summaries on the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_dashboard" /> are refreshed at the same frequency. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Data for New Published Content</b>
            <br />When content is first published (before data has been fetched/processed for it) <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> displays n/a (not available) for the item’s metrics in stream items, the Message Detail page, the Agenda, and the Detailed Analytics drill-downs. Once data has been fetched for the item, the n/a is replaced by 0 if there are no metrics (such as no likes, clicks or comments on the item) to display. </p>
        <h2>What’s the difference between Activity, Reach, and Engagement?</h2>
        <p>Activity, Reach, and Engagement are the three broad categories used to organize metrics in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />. Initiative metrics provide counts of actions such as posts, tweets, comments, photos, videos, and the like. Reach metrics describe the number of people who have seen, or may have seen, your content. Engagement metrics describe counts of audience actions in response to published content. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>If I delete an account, what happens to data associated with it?</h2>
        <p>If an account is deleted, the access token used for the service is deleted (so the system can no longer log in to the site), but the account record is retained, so that metrics associated with the account are kept, and activity published through it can still be seen. If the account is re-added, new data is stored and presented along with the retained former data. There will be a gap in data for the time the account was deactivated, but otherwise metric information remains intact. </p>
        <h2>How do the “Roll Up” values on the Detailed Analytics screen work? </h2>
        <p>It depends on the type of data being displayed. For Activity and Engagement counts, the roll-up number is the sum across the time period for all Account Sets and accounts in the Initiative. For individual metrics’ roll-up behavior, refer to the sections and tables for each metric type.</p>
        <h2>Why don’t I have recent data for Facebook Profiles, Facebook Notes (blogs), or Facebook Events?</h2>
        <p>In February, 2015, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> began using an updated version of the Facebook API (2.2) which no longer supports Profiles, Notes, or Events. Data collected for these accounts and activities prior to the change is still maintained in the platform, but no new data is available. </p>
