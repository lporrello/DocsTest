        <h1>Label Messages</h1>
        <p>You must have sufficient permissions on all messages you select; if you select a message for which you don’t have permissions, the menu is disabled. For labeling, you must have permission to edit the message (if it hasn’t been published yet) or have had permission to edit the message (if the message has been published already). If you apply a label that is part of a label group (mutually exclusive labels), and the message already has one of the group labels applied to it, the label is changed to the new one. For example, if you apply the label “closed” to a message that has “open” already applied to it, the label “closed” replaces the label “open.” </p>
