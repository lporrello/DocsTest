        <h1>Dashboard Panels</h1>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>Displays an up or down arrow to indicate whether activity has increased or decreased over the time period. Provides a count of the activity (messages) planned for and sent out from the Initiative. Compares current activity levels to previous ones. (For example, activity for the past seven days compared to the previous seven days.) Displays the percentage of planned activity that was published. </p>
        <p>Activity levels typically ebb and flow, but you always want to achieve an Engagement to Activity ratio that is appropriate for the objective of your Initiative. For example, if you are trying to build brand awareness, a high Engagement to Activity ratio is desirable; if you are managing customer complaints, you want a low Engagement to Activity ratio.</p>
        <h2>Engagement </h2>
        <p>Displays an up or down arrow to indicate whether engagement has increased or decreased over the time period. Provides a count of user interactions with your content. Compares current engagement levels to previous ones. (For example, engagement for the past seven days compared to the previous seven days.)</p>
        <p>Engagement levels typically ebb and flow, but you always want to achieve an Engagement to Activity ratio that is appropriate for Initiative's objective. Also, review the types of Engagement you have received in the past; if you have lost ground in certain channels or kinds of engagement, see if the format of your content or your habits of communicating have changed.</p>
        <h2>Total Reach</h2>
        <p>Displays an up or down arrow to indicate whether reach has increased or decreased over the time period. Provides a count of your “Reach”—the number of people who could have seen your content. Compares the current reach to that of the prior period; for example, if the current view shows reach for the past seven days, the system compares that value to the previous seven days. The panel also provides current values and percentage change for Current Network (the number of people who directly follow or friend your social accounts) and Total Impressions (the number of people who could have seen your content based on audience numbers for your network members). </p>
        <p>Is your Total Reach greater or lower than average compared to the previous time period? Examine current network numbers to see if you have been gaining or losing people with a direct relationship to your accounts. If you notice an unusual jump or decline, look at the daily trend in the <b>Detailed Analytics</b> table and examine activity published around the major gain/loss days to see if your content could be driving change. Also, are you generating more or fewer impressions through sharing of your content? If more, are there specific individuals responsible? What is your relationship with them? If fewer, can you target the content more towards your influential followers to generate more impressions through sharing? </p>
        <h2>Average Engagement by Publication Time</h2>
        <p>A bar graph that displays the average number of audience actions (engagement) generated by your activity based on the time of day the action was published. This metric reveals which publication times typically generate the most engagement</p>
        <p>Look for specific clusters of engagement to help determine the best time to publish content for your audience.</p>
        <h2>Top 10 Content by Engagement </h2>
        <p>A list of the top ten published items that resulted in reader engagement. Shows the name of the item, its publication date and time, and the engagement count. Click on the name of the message to see the Message Details.</p>
        <h2>Keyword Finds: First Five</h2>
        <p>A line graph that shows the trends in the number of times your first five keywords (from the 15 configured in <b>Initiative Settings</b> &gt; <b>Keywords</b>) are found across all streams. You can use this data to gauge the level of buzz your brand is generating, or monitor the level of buzz your industry or competitor is generating each day. Any content generated from your accounts (such as tweets or blog posts) has been automatically excluded. </p>
        <p>You can use only the Date Range filter for this panel.</p>
        <p>Look for spikes in keyword mentions and compare that to your activity to see if your marketing efforts are generating the buzz you would like.</p>
        <h2>Top 10 Mentions by Audience</h2>
        <p>A list of the top 10 mentions in Twitter based on audience size. Shows the mention, the user's follower count, and mentioner's username. </p>
        <p>For this panel, you can adjust only Date Range and Account Set filters.</p>
        <p>This metric helps identify who is spreading awareness of you to the most people. Try to discover the nature of your relationship with these Twitter users and how you can improve it.</p>
        <h2>Top 10 Users by Engagement</h2>
        <p>A list of the top ten users whose content (published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> or auto-imported) resulted in the most audience engagement. Shows the name of the user and the engagement count. (Auto-Import) appears as the Name if the content was auto-imported.</p>
        <h2>Activity Published with Links</h2>
        <p>A bar graph comparing all activity to activity containing links. Shows how often links were embedded in published activity. Includes counts of total activity, activity that contained a link, and activity that had a tagged link. This metric illustrates how often you provide content that makes it possible for your audience to click-through to your site. Note that this metric track links that are created in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />; not content that was auto-imported. Consequently, if much of your content is auto-imported, this panel may underestimate the number of links and their success in leading back to your site. </p>
        <p>If the numbers of links and clicks back to your site are lower than you want, examine the activity you publish; is there a good reason not to embed a link to your site? If not, try to be more mindful of providing links that lead your audience back to your site. </p>
        <h2>Published Activity by Content Type</h2>
        <p>A line graph comparing trends in your published activity by content type. Shows how much of each content type you publish over time. </p>
        <p>If you see spikes in certain content types, it could indicate high levels of response activity or an event that should be recognized and analyzed. For example, you may want to look at engagement for the same time frame to see if there were corresponding increases.</p>
        <h2>Published Activity by Channel (YTD vs. Range)</h2>
        <p>Two pie charts comparing how activity was divided among channels (social sites), for the current range compared to the year-to date. It may be noteworthy if there is a substantial change in the activity in a particular channel.</p>
        <p>For this panel, you can use all filters except Channel.</p>
        <p>If you see a significant difference between the current range data and the year-to-date values, look at the channels to see if anything is driving more (or less) content to them. Such a change may signal greater engagement in certain channels, or a specific problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
        <h2>Published Activity by Channel</h2>
        <p>A bar graph that displays trends in publishing activity, both through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> and auto-imported, by channel: the number of items you are publishing to each social site over time. </p>
        <h2>Published Activity Receiving Engagement</h2>
        <p>An up or down arrow that indicates whether engagement is increasing or decreasing. Shows the percentage of your activity that received engagement, such as comments, retweets or likes. Compares the engagement percentage for the current range to previous engagement percentages. For example, if you are viewing activity for the past seven days, the panel compares this percentage to the engagement percentage of the previous seven days.</p>
        <p>If the engagement percentage is lower than you want, examine your content more closely. Review past content that achieved a desirable engagement level and try to identify patterns. Also look at engagement by content type and channel to see if there are any engagement patterns that can help you optimize your content strategy.</p>
        <h2>Published Activity Link Distribution</h2>
        <p>A bar chart that shows how activity containing links is distributed across channels such as Facebook, Twitter, and the like. For each channel, the panel shows published activity that could have included a link but did not, activity that contained a link, and activity that contained no link.</p>
        <p>You can use all filters except for Channel on this panel.</p>
        <p>If there is significant activity that did not contain links on a particular channel, examine the activity for a cause. Try to be more mindful of providing a call to action and a link for those channels.</p>
        <h2>Clicks by Channel (YTD v Range)</h2>
        <p>Two pie charts comparing how your click-through engagement (clicks on embedded links) is divided among channels (social sites), both for the year-to-date and the current date range. It may be useful to determine if a particular channel is responsible for the majority of your audience's click-through behavior.</p>
        <p>You can use all filters except for Channel on this panel.</p>
        <p>If you see a significant change in distribution among channels from YTD to the current range, examine channel activity to identify what is driving more clicks from that channel. Try and identify patterns in the content that are driving more clicks.</p>
        <h2>Clicks/Published Activity with Links</h2>
        <p>Displays the ratio of click-throughs to published activity that contained a link. Illustrates whether your content yields an acceptable click-through rate. Compares the current ratio both to the previous time period and to a benchmark value. </p>
        <p>You can only adjust the date range filter for this panel. If you apply any of the other filters, the system cannot compare data to the previous time period trend or benchmark, so these items do not display. </p>
        <p>The benchmark value is determined by the system based on historical data, using both the Initiative's objectives (<b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Objectives</b>) and industry information (<b>Add Initiative</b> &gt; <b>Industry</b>). If the trend is unfavorable, examine Published Activity with Links, Link Distribution, and Published Activity by Channel metrics to see if enough link opportunities have been provided. If opportunity level is adequate, examine the content used for your call to action; perhaps the language can be adjusted to improve the click-through rates.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.admin content">Tech Only: Benchmark values are based on some historical analysis in the system’s early development years. When multiple Objectives and Industry items are selected, the system uses the first one it encounters. </p>
        <h2>Clicks per Other Engagement</h2>
        <p>Compares the number of clicks received on published activity compared to other types of engagement. Provides the percentage change in this value from the previous time period. </p>
        <p>Depending on your objectives for the Initiative, a high proportion of clicks back to your site can be a positive indicator. If the majority of your engagement is other types, such as mentions or likes, your Initiative may be successful from a brand awareness or knowledge sharing standpoint. </p>
        <h2>Current Network</h2>
        <p>An up or down arrow that indicates whether your network size is increasing or decreasing. Shows the total number of participants in your network (all friends, fans, followers, subscribers and the like) as well as the percentage change in network size compared to the previous time period.</p>
        <p>Look for positive growth trends in overall network size. If the number of participants is declining, examine your content to see if controversial material could be the cause.</p>
        <h2>Current Network Trend</h2>
        <p>A bar graph that shows the increase or decline in the number of people in your network, by channel (social site), over the specified date range.</p>
        <p>You can use only the Date Range filter on this panel.</p>
        <p>Look for positive growth trends in your overall network. If you notice that you are losing members, examine your published content as a potential reason for the decline.</p>
        <h2>Engagement by Type</h2>
        <p>A pie chart that displays the number of occurrences for each type of engagement (audience action) your activity has received over the selected time period. </p>
        <h2>Engagement/Published Activity</h2>
        <p>Displays the engagement to activity ratio: the average number of interactions per communication that you receive. Compares the ratio for the current time period to the previous one (for example, if the current filter shows data for the past seven days, the panel compares this data to the previous seven days). The ratio is also compared to a benchmark value. The benchmark value is determined by the system based on historical data, using both the Initiative's objectives (<b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Objectives</b>) and industry (<b>Add Initiative</b> &gt; <b>Industry</b>).</p>
        <p>You can only adjust the date range filter for this panel. If you apply any of the other filters, the system cannot compare data to the previous time period or benchmark, so these items do not display.</p>
        <p>Each company or brand will have different expectations for their Engagement to Activity ratio, depending on the size of the network and how engaged they are. Awareness-building social media campaigns, for example, typically want to yield a ratio of at least three interactions to one communication. Customer support efforts, by contrast, ideally generate fewer interactions per message.</p>
        <h2>Keyword Finds: Second Five</h2>
        <p>A line graph that shows the trends in the number of times your second five keywords (from the 15 configured in <b>Initiative Settings</b> &gt; <b>Keywords</b>) are found across all streams. You can use this data to gauge the level of buzz your brand is generating, or monitor the level of buzz your industry or competitor is generating each day. Any content generated from your accounts (such as tweets or blog posts) has been automatically excluded. </p>
        <p>You can use only the Date Range filter for this panel.</p>
        <p>Look for spikes in keyword mentions and compare that to your activity to see if your marketing efforts are generating the buzz you would like.</p>
        <h2>Keyword Finds: Last Five</h2>
        <p>A line graph that shows the trends in the number of times your last five keywords (from the 15 configured in <b>Initiative Settings</b> &gt; <b>Keywords</b>) are found across all streams. You can use this data to gauge the level of buzz your brand is generating, or monitor the level of buzz your industry or competitor is generating each day. Any content generated from your accounts (such as tweets or blog posts) has been automatically excluded.</p>
        <p>You can use only the Date Range filter for this panel.</p>
        <p>Look for spikes in keyword mentions and compare that to your activity to see if your marketing efforts are generating the buzz you would like. </p>
        <h2>Top 10 Content by Clicks</h2>
        <p>A list of activity (published through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> and auto-imported) responsible for the most click-throughs. Shows the activity name, publication date, and the click-through count. Click data is provided by Bitly. Click counts for links not shortened by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> can be unusually high. </p>
        <h2>Top 10 Mentioners</h2>
        <p>A list of the ten Twitter users who mention you the most. Shows the user, the date/time of the most recent mention, and the total number of mentions. </p>
        <p>For this panel, you can adjust only the Date Range and Account Set filters.</p>
        <p>Try and identify the nature of your relationship with these users and how you can improve it.</p>
        <h2>Top 10 Retweeted Content</h2>
        <p>A list of the top Twitter activity, based on number of retweets. Shows the name of the activity, the number of times it has been retweeted, and the total retweet audience.</p>
        <p>For this panel, you can adjust only the Date Range and Account Set filters. </p>
        <p>Look for patterns in this content that you can replicate in other Twitter content to drive higher retweet rates.</p>
        <h2>Top 10 Retweeters</h2>
        <p>A list of the ten Twitter users who retweet your tweets the most. Shows the user, the date/time of the most recent retweet, and the total number of retweets. </p>
        <p>For this panel, you can adjust only the Date Range and Account Set filters.</p>
        <p>Try and identify the nature of your relationship with these Twitter users and how you can improve it.</p>
        <h2>Total Impressions</h2>
        <p>An up or down arrow indicating whether impressions have increased or decreased over the time period. Displays the total number of impressions (potential plus confirmed) your content and brand have received through your social media presence and/or sharing. (To see the specific sources and values used to calculate this metric, click on <b>Analytics</b> &gt; <b>Detailed Analytics</b>, and scroll to see Potential Impressions and Confirmed Impressions.) <b>Potential impressions</b> are audience-based, which means that someone with an audience shared your content or mentioned you, but we cannot confirm that the audience actually saw the content. <b>Confirmed impressions</b> are view-based, which means that through tracking, we can be sure that the person saw either your page or content. This panel also compares these impressions to previous time periods to see if you are consistently generating more impressions over time. </p>
        <p>Look for positive trends in your total impression numbers. If these values are declining, examine your content to be sure you are providing clear calls to action and providing paths back to your websites. </p>
