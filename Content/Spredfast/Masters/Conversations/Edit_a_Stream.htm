        <h1>Edit a Stream</h1>
        <p>Only Search streams are editable. You can change search terms, but cannot change the channel using the Edit feature. Note that when you edit a search stream, all items found using the previous search definition are deleted. <MadCap:keyword term="Streams: edit; Edit: stream" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <b>Stream Management</b> (chevron) icon in the stream header and choose <b>Edit Stream</b><br />or</li>
            <li>Locate the stream in the Stream Library, and then click the pen icon (Edit).<br /><ol><li>In the <b>Search for all these words:</b> field, add or modify search terms.</li></ol><ol MadCap:continue="true"><li>To create a more complex search, click the <b>Advanced Search</b> checkbox. Enter search terms separated by commas. Search types are described in <MadCap:xref href="Search_Streams.htm">Search Streams</MadCap:xref>. Not all channels support advanced search functions; if the channel does not support the search criteria, the checkbox for the channel is disabled. You may be able to work around the issue, though, by using a wider search, and then filtering the results within the stream. </li></ol><ol MadCap:continue="true"><li>Twitter only—Each Twitter search-based stream must be associated with an authenticated Twitter account. By default, the stream is assigned to the account that has the fewest streams already associated with it. To change the assignment, click <b>Change account</b> and select it from the drop-down menu. Note that the number of search streams allowed for each Twitter account is limited, see <MadCap:xref href="Info.htm">Info</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="campaign-twitter-streams.htm">Twitter-Based Streams</MadCap:xref>.</li></ol><ol MadCap:continue="true"><li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li></ol></li>
