        <h2>Reply/Reply All</h2>
        <p>Now or at a scheduled time. To reply to all the people mentioned in a tweet, click <b>Reply</b>, then, in the <b>Text</b> field, click the new <b>Reply All</b> tab. The tab shows all the people to whom the reply will be sent.</p>
        <h2>Retweet</h2>
        <p>Now or at a scheduled time. Two types of retweet are supported in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />: “Native” and Editable. “Native” Retweet is similar to clicking Retweet on Twitter—the message is posted exactly as written (it cannot be edited) and no engagement metrics are collected for it. Editable retweets consist of RT@handle, plus the message text. These can be edited prior to publishing, and <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> collects engagement metrics on them.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Who Determines Permitted Tweet Types?</b>
            <br />Company Admins determine which type(s) of retweets are available to their users. See <MadCap:xref href="twitter_search_stream_he.htm">Twitter Admin Settings</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Direct Message/Reply to Direct Message</h2>
        <p>The user must be following you in order for you to be able to direct message. </p>
        <h2>Delete Your Own Tweet<MadCap:keyword term="Delete: Tweet" /></h2>
        <p>The same account that created the Inbox stream and published the tweet must be used to delete the tweet.)</p>
        <h2>Mark a Tweet as a “Favorite”</h2>
        <p>Click <b>Favorite</b>, select the accounts to use to Favorite the item (for all accounts, click <b>Available Twitter accounts</b>), then click <b>Favorite</b>. Once an item has been marked as a Favorite via <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, it can be Unfavorited as well. The history of “Favorite” actions taken in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" /> is shown in the stream item entry (account, date, and time). Note that the <b>Favorites</b> count shown is not the total number of times the item was Favorited on Twitter; it is the number of times the item was Favorited from <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_acro" />. </p>
