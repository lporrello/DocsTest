        <h2>Reply to Microblog Post on Profile</h2>
        <p>You can only reply through the account.</p>
        <h2>Comment/Reply</h2>
        <p>You can add a simple comment by clicking the Comment (or Reply) icon, typing in the content field, and clicking Comment (or Reply). <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> will use the account that originally created the stream to publish it. Or, click the <b>More options</b> button to use an expanded set of publishing features (other accounts, scheduling, notes, labels, etc.) for your post.</p>
        <h2>Like a Stream Item</h2>
        <p>Choose the account through which the like will be published; click an account from the list. If an account has already been used to like the item, it is grayed out in the list. If you choose multiple accounts, the like appears on Facebook once for each account chosen. The “Liked” count that appears in the expanded view of the item indicates the number of likes that have been applied to the item through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, not the total number of likes the item has received on Facebook. You can also “unlike” an item once it has been liked. Note that Facebook does not allow one to “Like” public posts. Search stream results are often entirely public posts, so the Like feature is unavailable on those streams. Consequently, if you have a collection that contains both search streams and non-search streams, the “Like” button appears on some items, but not others. </p>
        <h2>Reply to Private Message</h2>
        <p>If a Private Message stream for a Facebook page has been created, and you are an administer of the Facebook page, you can respond to private messages sent to the Facebook page using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />. You can send only two private messages without a response from the message author. After two messages have been sent without a response, the option to send a response is disabled until a message from the message author is received. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Spredfast.admin content">Note that as of 4.1.2 release, Facebook has not been enforcing the “two response” rule; consequently, it is not being enforced through <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />.</p>
        <h2>Hide a Post<MadCap:keyword term="Hide: Facebook post" /></h2>
        <p>Facebook page administrators can hide others’ posts on Facebook. From the <b>More actions</b> drop-down menu, select <b>Hide on Facebook</b>. The item displays a “hidden” icon, and also is added to the Hidden/Deleted stream. Once an item has been hidden, it can be “unhidden”—from the drop-down menu, select <b>Make visible on Facebook</b>. Note that the icon shown in the stream item represents the hide/unhide selections <b>made in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /></b>; we don’t monitor Facebook to see if item status has been changed by someone directly in Facebook. Also, any comments that have been made on hidden posts are still tracked by Facebook, and included in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />’s analytics.</p>
        <h2>Delete from Facebook<MadCap:keyword term="Delete: Facebook post" /></h2>
        <p>Facebook page administrators can delete posts and comments on posts. Deleted items are marked with a deleted (trash can) and added to the Hidden/Deleted stream. In situations when the items cannot be deleted from their native platform using <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, you have the option to mark them “deleted” so that <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> displays them in the Hidden/Deleted stream for tracking purposes.</p>
