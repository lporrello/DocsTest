        <p><MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_dashboard" /> displays graphs of the most important metrics for an Initiative. Use it to get a quick overview of Initiative status. You can choose which metrics appear on the dashboard from over 30 predefined charts. Information on the dashboard is updated at least twice a day. </p>
        <h2>Select Charts to Appear on the Dashboard</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_dashboard" />, click <b>Manage Panels</b>. </li>
            <li>To include a panel on the dashboard from the Available Panels column, click the + icon.</li>
            <li>To remove a panel from the <b>Active Panels</b> list, click the - icon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Panel Selections Apply Globally</b>
            <br />When you make changes to the dashboard, the changes appear to all users.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <b>Save Changes</b>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Many of the panels allow you to export the underlying data as a CSV or Excel file, or an image of the panel as a PDF. Click the chevron icon next to the title, click <b>Download As</b> button, and select a file type. </p>
        <p>By default, data presented on the dashboard spans the last 30 days. To change the time interval, or apply other filters to the dashboard, use the <b>Filters</b> feature. When using dashboard filters, remember that...<MadCap:keyword term="Filters: Initiative Dashboard" /> </p>
        <p>Applying the filter recalculates data for all the panels in the dashboard, not just the panel you're viewing.</p>
        <p>When building a filter, clicking a checkbox includes the checked item’s data, and excludes data for the unchecked items. For example, in the Content type criteria, checking “Blog” means that only data for blogs will be returned, and data for Microblogs, Photos, and Comments will not appear.</p>
        <p>In general, you can modify any filter criteria for any panel. However, some metrics have filters built in to their calculations (Top 10 Mentions by Audience uses only Twitter as the Social channel, for example), so adjustments you make to a Dashboard filter might not impact the results (if you filtered for Facebook, for example, and looked at the Top 10 Mentions by Audience). In such cases, the panel descriptions tell you which filters you can effectively adjust. </p>
