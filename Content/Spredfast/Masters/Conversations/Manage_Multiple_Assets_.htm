        <h1>Manage Multiple Assets </h1>
        <p>To select an asset to manage as part of a group, click the chevron (down arrow) in the upper left-hand corner of the asset panel. When an asset is selected, that corner turns from gray to green, and the <b>Selected</b> counter on the <b>Management</b> bar of the Content Center increases by one. To remove an item from the set, click the chevron again; it returns to its gray, unselected state. If you want to add or clear all assets at once, the chevron (down arrow) next to the <b>Selected</b> counter serves as an “Add All” or “Remove All” button. </p>
        <p>When multiple assets are selected, you can act on them according to your Content Center role and the level of access you have based on folder sharing rules. Appropriate action icons (Edit, Move, Delete) appear in the <b>Management</b> bar. </p>
