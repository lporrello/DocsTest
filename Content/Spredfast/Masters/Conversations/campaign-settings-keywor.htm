        <h1>Keywords<MadCap:keyword term="Initiative: keywords; Keywords (Initiative)" /></h1>
        <p>Use Initiative keywords to monitor trends in your content streams. Initiative keywords are intended to be relatively short-lived; for example, you might want to create keywords around a new product or advertisement. The system monitors all Inbox streams for appearances of the keyword, and presents the results in the keyword-related panels on the <b><MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.init_dashboard" /></b>. Note that the Dashboard panels are organized into <b>First Five</b>, <b>Second Five</b>, and <b>Last Five</b>. These refer to the order in which the keyword entries are displayed on this configuration screen: the first five fields, second five fields, and last five fields. </p>
        <p>To add Initiative keywords: In a blank keyword field, enter a term, phrase, or series of terms you want to monitor. You can use the same simple or advanced search syntax as is available when creating search streams. To reorder the keyword fields, drag and drop them within the <b>Keywords</b> screen. Click <b>Save</b>. </p>
