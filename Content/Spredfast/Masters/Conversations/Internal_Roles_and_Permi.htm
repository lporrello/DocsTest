        <p class="caution"><b>Internal Roles vs. Company Roles</b>
            <br />This section describes the roles and permissions that exist within the system for administering <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />. These must not be confused with customer roles and permissions that are assigned to end users within a customer company. Internal roles can be edited using Change User Role on the Admin Panel. Customer roles can be edited from the Users tab in My Company.</p>
        <p><b>Admin (<MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /></b>)—(for PM, DEV, CST, QA, OPS, SE, No customers):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> Admin Panel functions, including Impersonate.</li>
            <li>Can create custom user roles (company roles) in areas other than Content Center and Promotion. At one time, customers could create their own; now they can only be created by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> Admins, typically by Support. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>User</b>—(Customers): No Admin Panel access. </p>
        <p><b>Sales</b>—(<b><MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" /></b> sales reps for demo purposes): Admin Panel (Companies, Users, Edit)</p>
