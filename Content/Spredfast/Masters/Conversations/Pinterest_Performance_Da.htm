For example, if the date range is 60 days, the percentage is calculated by comparing the current data to data from the previous 60 day period. Click the percentage to see each account’s values for the current period, previous period, change (count) and change (percentage). The graph shows the trend in Follower count over multiple weeks; click on a week’s data point to see the Follower counts for each Board for that specific week.These values are calculated by <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.CompanyName_full" />. </p>
