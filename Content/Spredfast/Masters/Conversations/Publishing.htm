        <p class="note"><b>What to Do if You Cannot See Publishing Feature</b>
            <br />Call your system administrator. Most of the tabs and screens in <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> are configurable—an administrator must enable them before you can see and use them.</p>
        <p>You can post from anywhere within the Initiative. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the primary message types (microblogs): Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Weibo, LinkedIn Profile and Company updates, Pinterest Pins, click the channel-specific icon from the <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.SP_nav" /> &gt; <b>Publish</b> menu.</li>
            <li>To publish all other types of activity (videos, photos, LinkedIn Group discussions, blog posts, and microblog “Series” messages), click the circled <b>...</b> (ellipsis) icon next to the primary channel icons. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Changing Channels</b> <br />You can switch channels “on the fly”—start composing a message in one channel screen and switch to another before saving; all parts of the message that are common to both channels are populated. To do this, start composing your message in one channel. Then, click on the channel icon in the upper left-hand side of the composition page (next to Update Status). The icon becomes a drop-down menu showing the other channels you can change to. </p>
