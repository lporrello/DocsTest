        <h2>Account Set</h2>
        <p>Within <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" />, an Account Set is a container for one or more social media accounts. An Account Set is used to assign approval teams for outgoing content, and identify users who are allowed to publish to the accounts. </p>

        <h2>Alias</h2>
        <p>Within the Inbox, an “alias” is a unique, temporary name for a stream assigned by an individual user. It is seen only by the user who creates it, and is forgotten once the stream is deleted from a tab. (An aliased stream can be moved from one tab to another, however.) An alias helps a user distinguish between multiple instances of the same stream within a single tab (such as when different filters have been applied to each one, for example, and the user needs to tell them apart). To alias a stream, click on the tab so that the stream is visible, click on the stream’s name in the header, and provide a new name. See also <b>Rename</b>. </p>
