        <h1>Group Analytics<MadCap:keyword term="Initiative: Groups; Groups: Initiative" /></h1>
        <p>If users have created “groups” of initiatives to which they have access, such as a group of marketing initiatives or a group of sales initiatives, <MadCap:variable name="Spredfast.prod_full" /> provides aggregated metrics for the group. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Deduping of Metrics for Initiative Groups</b>
            <br />If an account is used for several Account Sets across multiple grouped initiatives, credential metrics for the account are deduplicated; that is, credential data for the account (such as number of followers) is only counted once. </p>
