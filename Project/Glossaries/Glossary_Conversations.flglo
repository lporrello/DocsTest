    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">Within the Inbox, an “alias” is a unique, temporary name for a stream assigned by an individual user. It is seen only by the user who creates it, and is forgotten once the stream is deleted from a tab. (An aliased stream can be moved from one tab to another, however.) An alias helps a user distinguish between multiple instances of the same stream within a single tab (such as when different filters have been applied to each one, for example, and the user needs to tell them apart). To alias a stream, click on the tab so that the stream is visible, click on the stream’s name in the header, and provide a new name. See also Rename.</Definition>
